### What You Need to Do
Before lab week, respond to this discussion post with your plan:

- **If attending both sessions**: List two instruments you want to learn. *(Full credit upon attendance, no summary required.)
- **If attending one or both sessions are missed**:
    - Provide a **makeup plan** (e.g., tutorials, methods papers, or targeted readings) to cover the missed work.
    - Be specific and include links to the materials when possible.
    - By the end of lab week, post a short summary (5 - 10 sentences) of what you learned from your plan.
      
### Deadlines

* **Pre-lab response**: Submit before the week of the lab sessions.
* **Makeup summaries (if required)**: Due by the end of lab week.

### Grading (50 points)

* **Pre-lab response (10 pts):** Confirm attendance or submit a makeup plan on time.
* **Attendance / Makeup (40 pts):**

  * Attend both sessions = 40 pts (automatic, no summary).
  * Missed sessions (one or both) + completed makeup summary = up to 40 pts.
  * Incomplete attendance/makeup = partial credit.
