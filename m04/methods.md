# Methods: Developing a robust research method

### Objective
Learn how to develop an instructive, reliable, and reproducible research method.

### Key objectives of the method section
- **Instructive**: Clearly explain how your research is conducted and organized.
- **Reliable**: Ensure your materials, chemicals, procedures, and models are suitable and valid for answering your research questions.
- **Reproducible**: Provide enough detail so that any researcher, including yourself, can follow your methods and replicate the study step by step.

### Common components of the method section
- **Site description**: Include location, climate, geography, history, and geology.
- **Study duration**: Specify the time frame of the study.
- **Experimental design**: Describe the structure and plan of your experiment.
- **Procedures**: Outline how to conduct the experiment—include the number of trials, conditions, and other key details.
- **Materials and chemicals**: Provide exact names (not generic or trade names) and sources of all materials and chemicals.
- **Instruments**: List instrument names, specifications, manufacturers, accuracy levels, and calibration details.
- **Samples**: Specify the number of samples collected, their locations, temperatures, and replication details.
- **Existing data products**: Indicate the source, resolution, time period, error margins, and relevant citations.
- **Equations and models**: List any mathematical models or equations used.
- **Metrics**: Define key metrics for analysis (e.g., model calibration and validation metrics).
- **Statistical analysis**: Include details such as ANOVA, p-values, model evidence, and the software used.
- **Ethics**: Address any ethical considerations and how they were handled.
- **Data management**: Provide a plan for managing and storing research data.
- **References**: Cite relevant studies and resources used.

### Writing Tips
- **Consult literature**: Review well-regarded examples in your field to understand the appropriate level of detail.
- **Use appropriate tense and voice**: Use past tense for completed actions and future tense for planned actions. Apply passive voice to emphasize the process over the actor.
- **Balance thoroughness with clarity**: Adjust the level of detail based on your audience and purpose (e.g., is the method well-established or newly developed and needing further explanation?).
- **Provide sufficient detail**: Ensure readers can replicate your method without trivial or redundant details. Reviewers expect transparency and reject poorly planned methods.
- **Use abbreviations thoughtfully**: Be cautious with abbreviations; ensure they are necessary and clearly defined.
- **Pay attention to units**:
   - Use **precise** units: *The mass of the sample is 0.5 mg* (imprecise use of 'weight').
   - Use **SI units**, with common alternatives in parentheses if needed: *Pumping rate of 500 m³/d (0.92 mgd)*.
   - Be **consistent** with units (e.g., mg/L vs. ppm).
- **Handle missing data**: Be transparent about how you handled data gaps or errors during the experiment.
- **Organize your method**: Structure the method logically, either chronologically or by themes, so readers can easily follow along.
- **Keep the method updated**: Draft your method before starting the experiment and refine it as the research progresses.

### In summary: Meticulousness pays off
>“Science, in the view of many of its eminent practitioners, is, after all, 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration, so precise work, and the ability to describe things accurately, is a necessary condition of credibility. Science may well comprise a lot of precise work and fewer grand ideas; you prove your mastery of the methods applied by being able to describe them with clarity, in sufficient detail.”
