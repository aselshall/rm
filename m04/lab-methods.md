| **Instrument**                  | **Description**       | **Use in water resources**                | **Example 1**                                   | **Exampe 2**     |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **ICP-MS**      | Measurement of trace elements where inductively coupled plasma ionizes the sample and a mass spectrometer separates and detects ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio | Measures trace metals in water and soil (e.g., Hg, Cd, As, Cr, Cu, and Zn) | Detect trace metals such as Cd from phosphate fertilizers and Pb and As legacy contamination | Test construction materials for harmful trace metals posing health risks |
| **TOC Analyzer/Nutrient Analysis** | Measures the amount of organic carbon in a sample by oxidizing organic compounds to CO2 and detecting the carbon content, along with analyzing nutrients like nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)| Assesses organic pollution and nutrient levels | Measure nutrients like N and P in water samples | Monitor organic contaminants in construction site runoff for environmental compliance |
| **HPLC**       | Separates compounds in a mixture by passing a liquid sample through a column with adsorbent material under high pressure, allowing identification and quantification of each component | Analyzes organic pollutants in water     | Quantify specific pesticides such as Atrazine and Glyphosate in groundwater samples collected during dye tracing experiments to determine the extent of pesticide transport | Analyze the composition of chemical admixtures |
| **GC/MS**       | Detecting and analyzing organic compounds by combining gas chromatography to separate compounds and mass spectrometry to identify and quantify compounds based on their mass-to-charge ratio | Analyzes volatile organic pollutants     | Identify and quantify volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, including pesticide residues such as Chlorpyrifos and DDT in groundwater and soil samples to provide data on pesticide pathways | Measure VOCs from construction materials like paints, coatings, and sealants for indoor air quality and environmental regulations |
