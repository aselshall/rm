### Project summary
The Peace River Watershed (PRW), encompassing 2,350 square miles in southwest Florida, provides a critical source of water supply, agriculture, phosphate mining, and recreation while sustaining vital ecosystem services for the community. PRW is an essential source of water to about one million residents of Charlotte, Desoto, Hardee, and Polk counties in southwest Florida. The PRW drains to Charlotte Harbor and its excess nitrogen load threatens the harborâ€™s ecosystem, fueling harmful algae blooms and red tides. Understanding the nitrogen loading and pinpointing source areas due to dynamic land use patterns and consequent spatial variation in nitrogen inputs is critical for effective nitrogen management. Analysis of total nitrogen loading using the Watershed Assessment Model (WAM) revealed significant variation in annual nitrogen loads across the basin, ranging up to 103 pounds per acre as indicated in the figure below. These disparities highlight the influence of point and non-point sources, emphasizing the need to identify potential hotspots. It is anticipated that agricultural and urban areas are primary contributors of nitrogen to local streams. Therefore, this project hypothesizes that enhanced urban waste management, including septic-to-sewer conversions with treatment and expanded BMP adoption in urban and agricultural sectors, will reduce basin-wide nitrogen loads. Given resource constraints, a comprehensive approach is impractical. Thus, the project aims to identify and prioritize areas for fertility BMPs, septic-to-sewer conversions, and urban wetland construction through a multi-dimensional selection process.
