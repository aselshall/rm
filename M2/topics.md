### How to Find a Project Idea
Choosing a project that aligns with your interests and showcases your research skills in water resources and environmental engineering is key. Here are some strategies to help you find the right project idea:
1. **Leverage Your Current Work**: Consider building on a project you are currently involved in, whether at work, with your supervisor, or for your degree. This allows you to apply and expand on what you are already doing.

2. **Explore Research Papers**: Dive into existing research papers to spark ideas. This can help you identify gaps or areas where you can contribute new insights.

3. **Build on Existing Projects**: Look at ongoing projects within your organization, FGCU, or community and find ways to enhance or extend them.

4. **Address Local Concerns**: Identify water resources or environmental issues specific to your local area that interest you. Engaging with local organizations or agencies can provide valuable opportunities. For instance, you could contact the [Director of Community Engagement at FGCU Service-Learning team](https://www.fgcu.edu/studentlife/servicelearning/aboutus#OurTeam) who can connect you with relevant local organizations.

5. **Seek Guidance**: Consult with your instructor for tailored project ideas that align with your interests and learning goals. The coursr instructor may direct you towards research projects that faculty members are currently working on.

6. **Explore Current Research Projects by Faculty Members**:
   - **A Three-Pillar Socio-Health-Environmental (TPSHE) Framework**: This project focuses on mitigating cumulative health impacts and environmental health disparities in polluted urban lakes within underserved communities. This specific task will involve developing machine learning-based methods to analyze chemical and non-chemical drivers -funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
   - **Model-Experiment (ModEx) Framework**: Aimed at advancing the understanding of fertilizer and pesticide reactive transport in rural agricultural areas, funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
   - **Nature-Based Infrastructure for Climate Resiliency**: This initiative focuses on enhancing the climate resiliency of groundwater resources in South Florida, funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
   - **Red Tide Water Quality Management Application (REMApp)**: This project involves water quality evaluation for the Peace River Basin and Greater Charlotte Harbor Watershed in Southwest Florida, funded by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP)
