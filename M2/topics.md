The key is to choose a project that aligns with your interests and allows you to demonstrate research your skills in water resources and environmental engineering. To get project ideas you can:
- **Your current work**: Leverage on a project that you currently doing at work, working on with your supervisor, or for your graduation
- **Research papers**: Explore research papers 
- **Build on existing projects**: Leverage on an existing project
- **Local concerns**: Identify an water resources or environmental problem specific to your local area that aligns with your interests or reach out to local  organizations or agencies. For example, contact the [Director of Community Engagement at FGCU Service-Learning team](https://www.fgcu.edu/studentlife/servicelearning/aboutus#OurTeam) and he will pair you with a local organization that suits your interest
- **Seek Guidance**: Consult with your instructor, who may have suggestions for tailored project ideas that suit your interests and learning goals. For example, you can get involved in research projects that faculty are currently working on.
