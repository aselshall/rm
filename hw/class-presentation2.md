## [Class Presentation 2 - Introduction based on in-depth literature review](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/class-presentation2)

### Objective
This class presentation is about your in-depth literature review. Your main focus shoud be your in-depth literature review and the introduction. It is unnecessarily to show method or results. You will present your in-depth literature review, research questions, and objectives to the class.  Use this opportunity to refine your research proposal through class feedback and discussion. This is to ensure that your introduction effectively sets the stage for your research by clearly defining the context, significance, research question, and objectives of your [research proposal](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/proposal-outline)

### Timeline and Requirements

#### 2. Presentation Week
- Watch at least 3 classmates’ presentations.
- Ask 1 question per presentation.
- Prioritize unanswered questions or those with fewer than 3 responses.

#### 3. Week After Presentation Week

- Complete 3 peer-evaluation rubrics(one for each reviewed presentation) and upload them to the Canvas discussion.

### Grading *(Participation Grade)*
- If you have not already selected a relevant topic that was **approved by your supervisor** by the presentation upload deadline, you will automatically recieve zero for this assignment.
- Presentation Upload (40 points)
  - On time slides upload in discussion.
  - And on time link shared in discussion.
- Peer Engagement (30 points)
  - Ask 3 questions 
  - Answer 3 questions
  - Negative credit (-30 points) for asking questions without fully watching the presentation or non-serious responses
- Peer Evaluation (30 points)
  - Upload the peer evaluation form on the discussion post on Canvas
  - Non-serious responses (e.g., giving full marks to all questions without justification) will receive no credit (and may result in negative credit if disruptive to the learning of other students).
- Presentation Evaluation (100 points)
  - See below for details  
- Late Submissions – Follow the [late submission policy](https://aselshall.github.io/gwh/#late-homework-policy).

### Presentation content 

**Introduction:**
- Provide a broad overview of your research topic to establish context
- Based on an in-depth literature review, clearly define the research problem you intend to address
- Based on an in-depth literature review, explain the significance of your research within the broader field

**Literature review summary:**
- Summarize key findings from your literature review that highlight the gap your research will fill
- Discuss relevant studies, theories, or models that support the foundation of your research

**Research question**
- Based on an in-depth literature review, clearly articulate your research question
- Ensure that your research question is specific, focused, and aligns with the gap identified in the literature review

**Research objectives**
- Clearly state the objectives of your research
- Ensure that your objectives are specific, measurable, and aligned with the research question

**Significance and contribution:**
- Discuss the potential contributions your research will make to the field
- Explain how your research will advance knowledge, address a gap, or solve a specific problem

**Questions for feedback:**
- Prepare 2-3 specific questions for your classmates and instructor to help refine your Introduction and clarify your research focus.

### Evaluation 
The points listed below are provided as a checklist to guide your preparation and ensure your presentation covers the learning objectives. These presentations are not graded for content. However, you are expected to meaningfully address each component as part of the exercise. Skipping or inadequately addressing a component will result in no credit for participation on that part.

1. Is in-depth literature review effectively used to define the research problem, and its significance? (65 points)
2. Does the presentation provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the research topic and context? (5 points)
3. Is the research problem clearly defined and effectively articulated? (5 points)
4. Is the research question specific, focused, and aligned with the identified research gaps from the literature review (5 points)
5. Are the research objectives well-stated, specific, and aligned with the research problem and research questions (5 points)
6. Does the presentation effectively communicate the significance and potential contributions of the research? (5 points)
7. Are the questions for feedback well-formulated and conducive to helpful discussion? (5 points)
8. Is the presentation clear, well-organized, and delivered effectively? (5 points)
