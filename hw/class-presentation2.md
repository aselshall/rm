## [Class Presentation 2 - Introduction based on in-depth literature review](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/class-presentation2)

### Objective
This class presentation is about your in-depth literature review. Your main focus shoud be your in-depth literature review and the introduction. It is unnecessarily to show method or results. You will present your in-depth literature review, research questions, and objectives to the class.  Use this opportunity to refine your research proposal through class feedback and discussion. This is to ensure that your introduction effectively sets the stage for your research by clearly defining the context, significance, research question, and objectives of your [research proposal](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/proposal-outline)
