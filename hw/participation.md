## [Participation Log](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/participation)

### Overview

Participation ensures consistent engagement and builds connections with your classmates and the instructor. At the end of each module (or combined modules, as shown on Canvas), submit your Participation Log using the provided format below.

### Objectives

This log promotes:
- Time management – Staying on track with deadlines
- Accountability – Ensuring fair, transparent grading
- Consistent engagement – Active involvement throughout the semester

### Participation Activities

- Watch 1–4 videos weekly and submit an exit ticket for each.
- Answer all embedded participation questions for credit.
- Provide complete, thoughtful responses as instructed.
- Your exit ticket reflection may include:
  - Key concepts or skills learned
  - Interest in further exploration
  - Application to your research
  - Challenges faced
  - Feedback on content or delivery
  - A simple “thank you” if no feedback is needed
- Exit Tickets and participation questions are due weekly


### Instructions for Logging
- For exist tickets and participation questions, you need to record
  - video title, date watched, exit ticket date
  - question title and response date

**Example Log:**

>| Video Title                                       | Date Watched | Exit Ticket Date | Title and Date of Answered Participation Questions |
>|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
>| Getting Started: Introduction to Research Methods | Aug 18       | Aug 19           | - What is research? on Aug 18 <br>- Engineering design vs. scientific research on Aug 18 <br> - Get to know each other on Aug 19 |
>| Fundamentals: Research Paradigms                  | Aug 19       | Aug 19           | - Research design on Aug 19 <br>- Research approach and design on Aug 19                                                 | 
>| Fundamentals: Research Question                  | Aug 26       | Aug 26           | - Research question on Aug 28  | 
>| Fundamentals: Research Proposal                  | Aug 27       | Aug 27           | - Research proposal: Learning objectives on Aug 28  | 
>

In the above example you will get: 
- 40 points for 4 exit tickets
- 70 points for answering 7 participation questions in the four videos


### Grading

- Full credit: All activities completed on time; log matches Canvas records.
- Partial credit: Incomplete, mismatched, or late logs (see [Late Submission Policy](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/#late-submission-policy)).
