### Overview

- Consistent engagement – Active involvement throughout the semester

### Participation Activities

- Watch 1–4 videos weekly and submit an exit ticket for each.
- Answer all embedded participation questions for credit.
- Provide complete, thoughtful responses as instructed.
- Your exit ticket reflection may include:
  - Key concepts or skills learned
  - Interest in further exploration
  - Application to your research
  - Challenges faced
  - Feedback on content or delivery
  - A simple “thank you” if no feedback is needed
- Exit Tickets and participation questions are due weekly


### Instructions for Logging
- For exist tickets and participation questions, you need to record
  - video title, date watched, exit ticket date
  - question title and response date

**Example Log:**

>| Video Title                                       | Date Watched | Exit Ticket Date | Title and Date of Answered Participation Question |
>|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
>| Getting Started: Introduction to Research Methods | Aug 18       | Aug 19           | - What is research? on Aug 18 <br>- Engineering design vs. scientific research on Aug 18 <br> - Get to know each other on Aug 19 |
>| Fundamentals: Research Paradigms                  | Aug 19       | Aug 19           | - Research design on Aug 19 <br>- Research approach and design on Aug 19                                                 | 
>| Fundamentals: Research Question                  | Aug 26       | Aug 26           | - Research question on Aug 28  | 
>| Fundamentals: Research Proposal                  | Aug 27       | Aug 27           | - Research proposal: Learning objectives on Aug 28  |

In the above example you will get: 
- 40 points for 4 exit tickets
- 70 points for answering 7 participation questions in the four videos
