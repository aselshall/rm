## Research proposal 
The main sections of a research proposal typically include the following:
1. [Title page](#1-title-page): Title, Name, Affiliation, Project Duration, etc.
2. [Project summary](#2-project-summary): Background, problem statement, objectives, methods, expected results, outcomes (usually 1-page, 250-350 words)
3. [Introduction](#3-introduction): Background and context, literature review, problem statement, research objectives/hypotheses
4. [Method](#4-method): Research design, study site, data collection methods, data analysis techniques, ethical considerations
5. [Expected results](#5-expected-results): Preliminary results, anticipated findings, deliverables, outputs, outcomes, and impacts
6. [Timeline](#6-timeline): Research schedule including key milestones, activities, personnel, and deadlines
7. [References](#7-references): List all references cited in the proposal, following the appropriate citation style (e.g., AGU)
8. [Appendices](#8-appendices-if-applicable): Supplementary information such as survey instruments, consent forms, detailed methods, budget, etc.

#### Problem statement: What you propose to study is clear and new
- Research question: Clear and concise description of what issue you are going to address 
- Justify the need for your research by linking to gaps or issues identified in literature review

#### Objectives: What do I exactly want to do
- Provide the list of objectives that will be achieved (specific actions and measurable steps) that directly connect to your research problem

### 4. Method
#### Research design

#### Study site/population
- Provide details about the study site, population, or sample, including any relevant characteristics or settings for your study 
#### Data collection methods
- What methods do you plan to use to collect data? (data collection procedure)
- why these methods are appropriate for your research objectives?
#### Data analysis techniques 
- How will you analyze the data? (data analysis procedure):
- Mention statistical tests, software, or analytical frameworks you will use 
- How will you validate your findings? (strategies for validating findings)
#### Ethical considerations
- What ethical issues will your study present? (anticipated ethical issues) such as informed consent, confidentiality, and potential risks to participants 

### 5. Expected Results
#### Anticipated finding and preliminary results 
- what do you expect to find based on the literature review and your research objectives
- What do preliminary results show about the practicability and value of the proposed study? (primarily pilot findings if available)

#### Deliverables
- What are the deliverables of your projects
- How will you know if  you succeed in delivering these outputs  

#### Outcomes and Impacts
- What  benefits  could  accrue  to the field and community if  the  project  is  successful

- Outcomes: Specific and measurable short-term effects
- Impacts: Broader and long-term effects

### 6. Timeline
#### Research schedule 
- Show how proposed timeline aligns with the scope of the research and the resources available.
  - Milestones: major phases or stages of the research, such as data collection, analysis, and writing
  - Deliverables: Specify the outputs expected at each stage, such data sets, preliminary findings, or final reports
  - Deadlines: Assign specific deadlines to each milestone and deliverable
- Schedule generally presented table format and Gantt chart showing start and end dates of each task, and overlapping and dependent activities

#### Contingency plans
- How you plan to address potential delays or challenges, ensuring that the project can still be completed within the proposed timeframe?

### 7. References
#### Citation of sources 
- Use citation management software like Zotero to manage references and link citations directly to the reference list
- Ensure all references adhere to the required citation style (e.g., AGU)
- Generate the reference list automatically using your citation management software
-  Review the reference list carefully to ensure all entries are complete and accurate.
