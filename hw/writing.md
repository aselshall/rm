4.1 Topic and concluding sentences

Improve your writing cohesiveness by using topic and concluding sentences. “The topic sentence is the first sentence in a paragraph. Its job is to introduce the main ideas of a paragraph. The concluding sentence is the last sentence in a paragraph. Its job is to summarize the main idea of the paragraph. If the paragraph is part of an essay, the concluding sentence also transitions to the next paragraph.” https://www.fusd1.org/cms/lib/AZ01001113/Centricity/Domain/800/Topic%20and%20Concluding%20Sentences%20Reference%20Sheet.pdf
 



6.4 Avoid long sentences and use punctuation  

“Storm water management is a common requirement in land development projects and it is important because land development comes with an increase in impervious areas and compacting of previous permeable undeveloped areas which can cause issues with how a watershed receives stormwater.”


6.5 Avoid coordinating conjunctions and use subordinating conjunctions

There is nothing grammatically wrong with starting a sentence with coordinating conjunctions such as but, nor, or and, or so. However, in academic and business writing it best to avoid starting a sentence with a coordinating conjunction.  Instead, use subordinating conjunctions and transition words such as such as however, in addition, on the other hand, etc. 
•	“But that issue does not appear …”
•	“However, this issue does not appear …”


6.6 Be succinct and cut the clutter 

In academic writing, we write the shortest sentence possible.  The rule is “Make sure the words you use add meaning. If you can remove words without losing the importance of the statement, delete them.”
•	As documented in a 2011 study by King et al., 2011 (11 words)
•	King et al. (2011) show (5 words)


6.7 Tenses used in academic writing

Tenses can be used both in passive and active voice. The most common tenses in order are:
•	Present simple is the default tense unless there is specific reason to choose another tense
o	This paper analyzes the impact of high temperatures on certain species.
o	Figure 1 shows that children ingest roughly 50-200 mg soil/day
•	Past simple is used to refer to actions or events completed in the past and to describe the methods from a completed experiment 
o	Rauscher et al., (2012) first documented this effect in their seminal paper.
o	After the war, Germany had to face strong reparations from the allied nations. 
o	Statistical analyses were used to determine relationships between variables.
•	present perfect is used to refer to previous research, which findings are relevant today. 
o	Some studies have found that girls have significantly higher fears than boys after trauma (Pfefferbaum et al., 1999; Pine and Cohen, 2002; Shaw, 2003).
o	While these measures have proved to be reliable and valid predictors of what they are measuring, there is little data on how they relate to each other.

6.8 Technical writing versus creative writing 

Overall, creative writing allows for more personal expression whereas academic/scholarly writing aims to explore an idea, argument, or concept.  Academic writing requires more factual evidence for support, and presents challenges such as the pressure of time.  They each have their own purpose, and as a developing writer, I hope to improve my writing of both types.
