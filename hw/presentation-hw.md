### [Research proposal: Presentation assignment](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/presentation-hw)

### Overview
In this presentation, you will communicate the core elements of your research proposal in a clear, organized, and professional manner. Your talk should demonstrate your understanding of the research problem, the significance of your study, and the soundness of your proposed methods. Specifically, your presentation should cover the key sections of the proposal outline: background and motivation, research objectives, methods, expected results deliverables, outcomes and impacts, and your project timeline with key milestones. This is not just an idea pitch but a professional presentation that shows you are ready to move from planning to execution. Treat this as a “proposal defense” where you must convince your audience that you have developed a solid, realistic, and impactful research plan.

- Non-serious submissions, such as giving all full marks without providing critical feedback, will be discarded, and no credit will be provided
