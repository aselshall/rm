### [Research proposal: Presentation assignment](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/presentation-hw)


**Date and Venue:** 
- This is an in-person presentation (not online)
- Dec-5 from 5:30 pm to 9:00 pm 
- Merwin Hall 105

**Time:**  
- Total Time: 15 minutes per presentation
- Presentation: 12 minutes
- Q&A and Transition: 3 minutes
- Presentation order by name as shown on Canvas

**Guidelines:**
- The instructor will collect your peer-evaluation forms at the end of the class so do not forget to add your name on them
- Peer-evalaution forms will be provided so you do not need to print any thing
- Thoughtful and constructive evaluations are expected
- Non-serious submissions, such as giving all full marks without providing critical feedback, will be discarded, and no credit will be provided
- This is a big class, so you need to upload your final powerpoint slides on Canvas at least 2 hours before class
- Failure to do so will disrupts class organization and will result in 10% deduction from your presentation grade. In professional settings, such as conferences, failing to meet upload deadlines can result in the cancellation of your presentation.

**Evaluation:**
- For detailed criteria, review the [presentation rubric](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/presentation-rubric) , which you can also download from this [Link](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/Presentation%20rubric.docx).

**Grade:**
- 90 points: Presentation
- 10 points: Peer-evaluation forms
