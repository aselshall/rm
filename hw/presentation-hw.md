### [Research proposal: Presentation assignment](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/presentation-hw)

**Date:** 
- Dec-10 from 4:30 pm to 6:00 pm 

**Time:**  
- Total Time: 15 minutes per presentation
- Presentation: 12 minutes
- Q&A and Transition: 3 minutes

**Guidelines:**
- Reserve your time slot by writing your name on [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G-99MJ8G02TWRa-Wj1ddzGLvPtAC-wa310zh5G30alo/edit?usp=sharing), first come, first served!
- I will collect your peer-evaluations at the end of the class. This will count as your participation grade for this class, so do not forget to add your name on them. Non-serious submissions, such as giving all full marks without providing critical feedback, will be discarded, and those grades will not count. Thoughtful and constructive evaluations are expected.
- Upload your final presentation on Canvas at least 30 minutes before class. Failure to do so disrupts class organization and will result in a 50% deduction from you participation grade for this class. In professional settings, such as conferences, failing to meet upload deadlines can result in the cancellation of your presentation.

**Evaluation:**
- For detailed criteria, review the [presentation rubric](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/presentation-rubric) , which you can also download from this [Link](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/Presentation%20rubric.docx).
