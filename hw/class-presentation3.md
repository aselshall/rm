### Objective

This presentation is focused on developing and refining the Methods section of your research proposal. Use this opportunity to present your proposed research design, data collection, and analysis methods, ensuring they are appropriate, feasible, and well-aligned with your research question and objectives.

### Timeline and Requirements

#### 1. Week Before Presentation Week
- Record your presentation (max 15 minutes).
- Upload your presentation slides to Canvas discussion by the due date.
- Share your recorded presentation link in the Canvas discussion by the due date (do not upload large video files directly).
- Recording options:
  - Record live on YouTube with OBS ([Tutorial](https://youtu.be/zOhh6MclooA?feature=shared))
  - Record in PowerPoint ([Tutorial](https://youtu.be/bP9VJ03s8Gw?feature=shared)) and upload to YouTube or OneDrive ([instructions](https://github.com/aselshall/gwh/blob/main/hw/How%20to%20Upload%20a%20Video%20to%20OneDrive.docx))

#### 2. Presentation Week
- Watch at least 3 classmates’ presentations.
- Ask 1 question per presentation.
- Prioritize unanswered questions or those with fewer than 3 responses.

#### 3. Week After Presentation Week
- Respond to all questions you receive.
- Complete 3 peer-evaluation rubrics(one for each reviewed presentation) and upload them to the Canvas discussion.

### Grading 
- If you have not already selected a relevant topic that was **approved by your supervisor** by the presentation upload deadline, you will automatically recieve zero for this assignment.
- Presentation Upload (40 points)
  - On time slides upload in discussion.
  - And on time link shared in discussion.
- Peer Engagement (30 points)
  - Ask 3 questions 
  - Answer 3 questions
  - Negative credit (-30 points) for asking questions without fully watching the presentation or non-serious responses
- Peer Evaluation (30 points)
  - Upload the peer evaluation form on the discussion post on Canvas
  - Non-serious responses (e.g., giving full marks to all questions without justification) will receive no credit (and may result in negative credit if disruptive to the learning of other students).
- Presentation Evaluation (100 points)
  - See below for details  
- Late Submissions – Follow the [late submission policy](https://aselshall.github.io/gwh/#late-homework-policy).

### Presentation content

**Research question and objectives recap:**
- Begin with a brief recap of your research question and objectives to remind the audience of the focus of your study

**Research design:**
- Describe the overall design of your study (e.g., experimental, observational, qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods)
- Justify why this design is suitable for addressing your research question

**Study site and sample:**
- Provide details about the study site or population/sample you plan to study
- Explain why this site or sample is appropriate for your research
- Discuss any sampling techniques you will use

**Data collection methods:**
- Outline the methods you will use to collect data, including any tools, instruments, or procedures
- Justify why these methods are appropriate for your research objectives

**Data analysis techniques:**
- Describe the techniques you will use to analyze the collected data
- Mention any software or analytical tools you plan to use
- Explain how these techniques will help you answer your research question

**Ethical considerations:**
- Discuss any ethical issues related to your research and how you plan to address them (e.g., informed consent, confidentiality, risk minimization)

**Questions for feedback:**
- Prepare 2-3 specific questions for your classmates and instructor to help refine your Methods section, especially regarding feasibility, appropriateness, and clarity.

### Evaluation 
The points listed below are provided as a checklist to guide your preparation and ensure your presentation covers the learning objectives. These presentations are not graded for content. However, you are expected to meaningfully address each component as part of the exercise. Skipping or inadequately addressing a component will result in no credit for participation on that part.

- Does the presentation provide a clear and detailed research design that is appropriate for the research question?
- Are the study site and sample well-chosen and clearly explained?
- Are the data collection methods appropriate, well-justified, and clearly articulated?
- Are the data analysis techniques appropriate, well-justified, and clearly explained?
- Does the presentation effectively address ethical considerations?
- Is the presentation clear, well-organized, and delivered effectively?
- Are the questions for feedback well-formulated and conducive to helpful discussion?
