## [Class Presentation 1 - Exploratory literature review and research problem](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/class-presentation1)

### Objective
Conducting an exploratory literature review will help you to read the literature to learn about your problem and define a good research problem. You will present your literature review findings and your research problem to the class. Use this opportunity to refine your research problem through class feedback and discussion. This is to help you to ensure that you are on track for a clear, relevant, and feasible proposal.
