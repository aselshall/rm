## [Class Presentation 1 - Exploratory literature review and research problem](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/class-presentation1)

## Objective
Conducting an exploratory literature review will help you to read the literature to learn about your problem and define a good research problem. You will present your literature review findings and your research problem to the class. Use this opportunity to refine your research problem through class feedback and discussion. This is to help you to ensure that you are on track for a clear, relevant, and feasible proposal. 

### Timeline and Requirements

#### 1. Week Before Presentation Week
- Record your presentation (max 15 minutes).
- Upload your presentation slides to Canvas discussion by the due date.
- Share your recorded presentation link in the Canvas discussion by the due date (do not upload large video files directly).
- Recording options:
  - Record live on YouTube with OBS ([Tutorial](https://youtu.be/zOhh6MclooA?feature=shared))
  - Record in PowerPoint ([Tutorial](https://youtu.be/bP9VJ03s8Gw?feature=shared)) and upload to YouTube or OneDrive ([instructions](https://github.com/aselshall/gwh/blob/main/hw/How%20to%20Upload%20a%20Video%20to%20OneDrive.docx))

#### 2. Presentation Week
- Watch at least 3 classmates’ presentations.
- Ask 1 question per presentation.
- Prioritize unanswered questions or those with fewer than 3 responses.

#### 3. Week After Presentation Week
- Respond to all questions you receive.
- Complete 4 peer-evaluation rubrics(one for each reviewed presentation) and upload them to the Canvas discussion.

 - Discuss how you identified this problem, including any gaps or issues in the existing literature that led you to this focus

**Relevance and importance:**
 - Justify why this research problem is important to study
 - Highlight the potential impact of addressing this problem on the field and/or society

**Scope and Feasibility:**
 - Describe the scope of your research problem
 - Discuss the feasibility of investigating this problem within the constraints of time, resources, and your current skillset

**Questions for feedback:**
 - Prepare 2-3 specific questions for your classmates and instructor that will help you refine your research problem


## Evaluation 
The points listed below are provided as a checklist to guide your preparation and ensure your presentation covers the learning objectives. These presentations are not graded for content. However, you are expected to meaningfully address each component as part of the exercise. Skipping or inadequately addressing a component will result in no credit for participation on that part.
 1. Is exploratory literature review effectively used to define the research problem, and its significance? (65 points)
    - At least 6 peer-reviewed papers are cited throughout the presentation and referenced at the end
    - If sources are not effectively cited during the presentation or referenced at the end you will recieve zero
    - Non-serious responses will receive negative credit (-65 points)  
 2. Is the topic clearly introduced? (5 points)
    - Check Writing Your Review lesson for details
 3. Is the research problem clearly articulated and well-defined? (5 points)
    - Check Research Question lessor for details
 4. Does the presentation effectively communicate the significance and potential impact of the research problem? (5 points)
 5. Is the scope of the research problem appropriate, and is the feasibility of the study well-considered? (5 points)
    - Mention her your discussion with your supervisor about scope and feasibility for credit 
 7. Is the presentation clear, well-organized, and delivered effectively? (5 points)
 8. Are the questions for feedback well-formulated and conducive to helpful discussion? (5 points)
