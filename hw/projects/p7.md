## Sea-Level Rise, Real Estate, and Climate Change Literacy: A Behavioral Study in Naples, Florida

Faculty Member: Ahmed Elshall

### Project Summary

As sea-level rise increasingly threatens coastal communities, public understanding of climate risk plays a critical role in shaping social, economic, and planning decisions. This project investigates how knowledge of sea-level rise and climate change alters real estate perceptions and decision-making in Naples, Florida, a region that is considered ground-zero for sea-level rise in the US. Using a combination of environmental datasets and public surveys, the study evaluates how homebuyers’ and sellers’ perceptions shift before and after being presented with localized climate risk information.

The research explores:
- How climate risk awareness influences willingness to buy or sell in vulnerable areas
- Whether access to environmental data (e.g., flood risk on real estate platforms) changes real estate valuation expectations
- How climate change literacy affects trust in market trends and adaptation policies

This project uses a pre/post survey design with randomized information treatments to assess behavioral and attitudinal shifts. By linking environmental science with human decision-making, the study provides valuable insights for urban planners, real estate professionals, and policymakers aiming to improve climate adaptation through informed public engagement.

The outcomes have broad implications for climate risk communication, and the future resilience of housing markets in coastal communities. This interdisciplinary work is highly relevant to journals in climate communication, urban planning, real estate economics, and sustainability science.
