## Enhancing Student Understanding of Reinforced Concrete Structures in Construction Management
Faculty Member: Anh D. (Andy) Chau   
Funding Requested: $1,000 Course: BCN 3431C Structures for Construction Department: Stock Development Department of Construction Management, U.A. Whitaker College of Engineering, FGCU  

### Project Summary

The focus of this project is to enhance the educational experience of students enrolled in the BCN 3431C Structures for Construction course by providing hands-on learning opportunities in reinforced concrete structures. The project will fund two lectures, and two labs centered around the assembly and understanding of reinforced concrete beams and columns. These activities will enable students to gain practical experience with the materials and techniques used in construction, aligning with the course's objective of understanding the basic principles of structural behavior (ACCE SLO 19).

The labs will involve assembling reinforced concrete beams and columns, using equipment like rebar tying machines and twisters, and discussing critical concepts such as positive and negative moments in concrete structures. This hands-on approach will prepare students for their future careers by reinforcing theoretical knowledge with practical application.

#### Objectives
- Introduce students to the components and functions of reinforced concrete beams and columns.
- Apply standards for rebar splicing and examine connections at beam-column junctions.
- Enhance student engagement and understanding through practical assembly tasks and discussions.

#### Impact 

This project is anticipated to significantly improve students' readiness for the construction industry by providing essential hands-on experience. The funding will ensure that students have access to the necessary materials and equipment, thereby enhancing the overall quality of education in the Construction Management program.
