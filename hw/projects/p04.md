## Scenario Analysis of Nutrient Loading Mitigation to Reduce Red Tide Risk

Faulty members: Ahmed S. Elshall and Seneshaw Tsegaye

### Project summary

This project evaluates how reductions in total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loading from the Peace can mitigate red tide formation. Students will use machine learning to simulate multiple nutrient management scenarios and analyze their impact on red tide probabilities. The work includes developing and testing supervised classification models, performing sensitivity analysis, and conducting in-silico experiments to guide nutrient mitigation strategies. The results will inform regional water quality management and red tide prevention efforts.
