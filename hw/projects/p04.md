## Scenario Analysis of Nutrient Loading Mitigation to Reduce Red Tide Risk

Faulty members: Ahmed S. Elshall and Seneshaw Tsegaye

### Project summary

This project evaluates how reductions in total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loading from the Peace can mitigate red tide formation. Students will use machine learning to simulate multiple nutrient management scenarios and analyze their impact on red tide probabilities. The work includes developing and testing supervised classification models, performing sensitivity analysis, and conducting in-silico experiments to guide nutrient mitigation strategies. The results will inform regional water quality management and red tide prevention efforts.


### Reducing Input Data Uncertainty
Data augmentation techniques like jittering, scaling, window slicing, and time warping produce modified copies of the data points. Scaling techniques less sensitive to outliers, such as using the median and interquartile range for normalization, can also be employed. Creating a reanalysis data set that combines observation data and simulations from process-based models like the WAM models we developed can further improve streamflow and water TN and TP input data. Evaluating the effectiveness of data assimilation, reanalysis data, and data augmentation for this problem is essential. Examples from literature provide insights into these methods:

### Enhancing Interpretability

We can use tools like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to understand the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions. Attention mechanisms like DA-RNNs or TFT can help analyze the attention weights to determine which input features the model focuses on at different time steps. Partial dependence plots can show the relationship between a feature and the predicted outcome, holding all other features constant to provide insights into model behavior across different feature values. Additionally, decision rules or decision sets extracted from models can provide causal explanations. Visualization tools that map the model predictions back to the input space make it easier to understand the temporal relationships captured by the model.
