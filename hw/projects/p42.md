### Novel DL Architecture for Time Series Analysis

To address both interpretability and uncertainty analysis in predicting harmful algal blooms, developing a Bayesian Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) architecture can be beneficial. This architecture, combining Bayesian neural networks with a TFT, offers a probabilistic approach to time series forecasting. The TFT integrates recurrent layers, attention mechanisms, and temporal convolutions to handle multivariate time series data efficiently. Replacing some or all of the dense layers within the TFT with Bayesian layers, which learn a distribution over the weights, enhances model uncertainty estimation. Implementing Monte Carlo (MC) dropout in the recurrent or convolutional layers of the TFT can further refine predictions. Using SHAP or LIME for post-hoc interpretability and leveraging attention weights within the TFT provides insights into the most relevant input features and time steps for making predictions.
