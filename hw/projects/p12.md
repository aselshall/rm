Emerging automated quality control (QC) systems from AI-driven defect detection to sensor-based monitoring are transforming how construction quality is measured. However, research often centers on the technical performance of these systems, with little attention to how workers and supervisors perceive, trust, and integrate them into existing workflows. This project investigates the human factors influencing the adoption and effective use of automated QC tools in specialty construction.

Key Research Questions:
1.	How do specialty trade professionals perceive the reliability and fairness of automated QC systems?
2.	What are the main barriers and enablers to adoption?
3.	How do workers respond when automated QC findings contradict their professional judgment?
4.	What training or support is needed to integrate these systems effectively?

Data Collection:
-	Method: Semi-structured interviews (45–60 minutes).
-	Sample:
    - Electrical inspectors
    - Welding/structural steel QC supervisors
    - Concrete finishers and foremen
    - MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) project engineers
-	Sample size: 15–20 participants for thematic saturation.
-	Recruitment: Through large specialty contractors, union chapters, industry conferences.

Why It’s Important:
-	QC is central to construction safety, cost control, and compliance.
-	Automated QC tools are growing in prevalence but risk low adoption if human trust is not addressed.
-	Your research could produce practical adoption guidelines to help vendors and contractors improve implementation success.
-	Aligns with “construction quality hazard management” trends in major journals, but adds a unique qualitative, human-centered lens.

Expected Output:
-	Insights into worker trust, resistance, and acceptance.
-	Recommendations for aligning QC technology design with field practices.
