## Evaluating the impact of land use and nature-based solutions on groundwater recharge in South Florida

Faulty members: Ahmed S. Elshall and Seneshaw Tsegaye   

### Project Summary

This project investigates the relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) changes, daily precipitation, and groundwater levels in South Florida to support the implementation of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) for groundwater recharge. Using Sentinel-2 imagery, the study will classify LULC patterns from 2015 to the present and analyze their correlation with precipitation and groundwater data. Statistical and spatial analyses will evaluate how different land uses and water management practices, including NBS strategies like wetland restoration, influence groundwater dynamics. The project aims to identify effective LULC management approaches and provide actionable recommendations to enhance groundwater sustainability in the region.
