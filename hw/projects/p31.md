### Background and Motivation

Brackish-water reverse osmosis (BWRO) desalination facilities provide essential drinking water in coastal and water-stressed regions. Their long-term performance depends on the interaction between wellfield design, aquifer hydrogeology, and pumping-induced water quality changes. A recent study of the South Collier County BWRO facility demonstrated that conventional solute transport models often overpredict salinity increases, overlooking downward leakage and fresher recharge. This highlights a broader knowledge gap: utilities frequently design BWRO wellfields without long-term validation of conceptual models or systematic data audits.

Obtaining **wellfield design specifications and monitoring data** from utilities that operate BWRO facilities is therefore a critical step in reassessing predictive models and improving operational resilience. Such data would allow statistical evaluation of chloride/TDS trends, model recalibration, and the development of revised aquifer conceptual models that more accurately capture salinity dynamics.

### Key Research Questions

1. How does wellfield design (e.g., number of wells, screened intervals, pumping distribution) influence long-term water quality trends in BWRO feedwater?
2. What discrepancies exist between predicted solute transport model outputs and observed monitoring data?
3. Can new conceptual models (e.g., incorporating downward leakage and lateral fresher inflows) better explain actual field performance?
4. What are the implications of these findings for future BWRO facility planning and utility decision-making?

### Data Collection

* **Data Needs**: Wellfield design parameters (well depths, screened intervals, capacities), historical pumping records, and water quality monitoring (chloride, TDS, conductivity).
* **Sources**: Direct requests to utilities that operate BWRO facilities (e.g., Collier County Utilities, Cape Coral, Clearwater, Fort Myers).
* **Analysis Approach**:

  * Statistical regression of chloride/TDS trends per well.
  * Comparison of observed trends to original solute transport model predictions.
  * Conceptual model revision based on hydrogeologic interpretation.
  * Visualization of data through figures and thematic maps.

### Why Itâ€™s Important

Most BWRO facilities are designed assuming upward migration of saline water into production zones. However, the Collier County case shows that this assumption may be incorrect in many systems. A systematic post-audit across multiple utilities would:

* Improve predictive groundwater modeling for BWRO feedwater.
* Enhance long-term operational reliability and cost-effectiveness of desalination plants.
* Provide publishable insights of high relevance to journals in hydrogeology, water resources, and desalination.
* Offer applied research opportunities for graduate students in groundwater hydrology, modeling, and water resources engineering.

### Expected Output

* **Manuscript for peer-reviewed publication** on improved conceptual models for BWRO wellfields.
* **Figures and statistical analyses** of wellfield pumping and salinity trends.
* **Recommendations** for utilities on data collection, model recalibration, and long-term monitoring.
* **Training opportunities** for students in groundwater modeling, desalination systems, and applied water research.
