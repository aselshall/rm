## Analyzing the Role of Temperature in Red Tide Dynamics Using Machine Learning

Faculty member: Ahmed S. Elshall  

## Project Summary:

This project focuses on evaluating the influence of temperature on the development and persistence of red tide events in the Gulf of Mexico. Using historical datasets—including sea surface temperature, Karenia brevis counts, river discharge, and weather data—students will apply machine learning models (e.g., decision trees) to identify how temperature variability contributes to the maintenance or termination of red tide blooms. The project will involve data preprocessing, feature importance analysis, and model validation to assess temperature’s predictive significance in red tide risk assessment.
