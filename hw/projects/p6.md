### Project summary
The Peace River Watershed (PRW), encompassing 2,350 square miles in southwest Florida, provides a critical source of water supply, agriculture, phosphate mining, and recreation, while sustaining vital ecosystem services for the community. PRW is an essential source of water for about one million residents of Charlotte, Desoto, Hardee, and Polk counties in southwest Florida. The PRW drains to Charlotte Harbor, and its excess phosphorus load threatens the harbor's ecosystem, fueling harmful algae blooms and red tides. Understanding the phosphorus loading and pinpointing source areas due to dynamic land use patterns and consequent spatial variation in phosphorus inputs is critical for effective phosphorus management. Analysis of total phosphorus loading using the Watershed Assessment Model (WAM) revealed significant variation in annual phosphorus loads across the basin, ranging up to 35 pounds per acre, as indicated in the figure below. These disparities highlight the variation in nutrient loading observed in mining areas, demonstrating the need to identify potential hotspots where nutrient levels are particularly high. It is anticipated that phosphate mining, urban and agricultural areas are primary contributors of phosphorus to local streams. Therefore, this project hypothesizes that introducing Best Management Practices (BMPs) in mining. urban and agricultural areas will reduce basin-wide phosphorus loads. Thus, the project aims to review, identify, and prioritize areas for phosphorus management using a multi-dimensional selection process.
