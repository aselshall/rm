## Project 4: Building Supply Chain Resilience in U.S. Construction — Strategies, Adaptations, and Lessons from the Field

This study examines how construction professionals navigate ongoing supply chain disruptions driven by material shortages, price volatility, and policy changes such as tariffs or tax reforms. While macroeconomic analyses often highlight these challenges in aggregate, little is known about how decisions are made in real time at the project level to keep work on schedule and within budget. This research will focus on capturing the lived experiences of procurement managers, project leaders, and specialty contractors as they adapt sourcing strategies, adjust designs, or renegotiate contracts in response to uncertainty.

### Key Research Questions
1.	What supply chain disruptions most significantly impact active construction projects in the current economic and political climate?
2.	How do contractors and suppliers adapt procurement strategies under conditions of uncertainty?
3.	What trade-offs are made between cost, quality, and schedule when materials are delayed or prices spike?
4.	Which resilience strategies (e.g., diversified suppliers, material substitution, early ordering) are perceived as most effective?

### Data Collection
-	Method: Semi-structured interviews (45–60 minutes) with optional document collection (e.g., procurement logs, change orders).
-	Sample:
    -	Procurement managers for general and specialty contractors
    -	Project managers actively facing material delivery challenges
    -	Supplier representatives involved in construction material distribution
-	Sample size: 20–25 participants for thematic saturation.
-	Recruitment: Through contractor associations, local AGC chapters, and supplier networks.

### Why It’s Important
-	Supply chain resilience has become a key determinant of project success, especially with unpredictable policy and market shifts.
-	Findings could inform best-practice guides for procurement and project planning under uncertainty.
-	Strong relevance for both construction management and supply chain research audiences.

### Expected Output
-	Categorization of common disruption types and their project impacts.
-	Field-tested strategies for increasing procurement resilience.
-	A decision-making model for balancing schedule, cost, and quality during supply chain crises.
