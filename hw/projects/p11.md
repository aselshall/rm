## Project 1: Specialty Contractor Experiences in Post-Hurricane Recovery and Resilience Construction in Southwest Florida

This study aims to explore the lived experiences, challenges, and adaptive strategies of specialty contractors working on post-hurricane reconstruction projects in Southwest Florida. While quantitative studies have documented timelines and cost escalations after disasters, there is a lack of qualitative insight into how tradespeople navigate unique constraints such as code changes, supply shortages, and coordination in chaotic post-disaster environments.

### Key Research Questions
1.	How do specialty contractors adapt their workflows and methods for post-hurricane reconstruction compared to standard projects?
2.	What are the main challenges they face (e.g., supply chain, permitting, workforce availability)?
3.	How do updated building codes and resilience standards affect their work?
4.	What lessons can be applied to improve future disaster recovery efforts?

### Data Collection
-	Method: Semi-structured interviews (45–60 minutes).
-	Sample:
    -	Roofing contractors
    -	Electrical contractors
    -	Structural repair specialists
    -	Building inspectors (public sector)
    -	Project managers for insurance-funded rebuilds
-	Sample size: 15–25 participants for thematic saturation.
-	Recruitment: Local trade associations, building permit offices, contractor networks.

### Why It’s Important
-	Florida is hurricane-prone; recovery speed and quality directly affect community resilience.
-	Specialty contractors are critical but underrepresented in disaster research.
-	Findings can inform policy, training programs, and resilience-focused construction practices.
-	High relevance to resilience-focused journals and conferences.

### Expected Output
-	Thematic map of challenges and adaptive strategies.
-	Recommendations for improving disaster recovery workflows.
