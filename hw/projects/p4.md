## Red tide water quality management application (REMApp) 
Faulty members: Ahmed S. Elshall   
Funding: Florida Department of Environmental Protection - Water Quality Evaluation for Peace River Basin and Greater Charlotte Harbor Watershed in Southwest Florida

### Project summary
The goal is to develop a REd tide water quality Management Application (REMApp).  The overarching objective of this task is to develop a machine learning-based tool for predicting red tide in the Gulf of Mexico along the West Florida Shelf. The tool can be used to assess the role of river discharge and nitrogen and phosphorus loading on the probabilities of the maintenance and termination stages of red tides in the upper estuary and area of estuarine flux. The input datasets are (1) Karenia brevis cell count, (2) sea-surface height, (3) Peace River and Caloosahatchee River discharge, (4) total nitrogen loading and total phosphorus loading in Peace River and Caloosahatchee River, (5) wind speed and direction, (6) temperature, (7) precipitation, and (8) depositional dust.  Standard machine learning architectures (e.g., decision tree, support vector machine, and artificial neural network) for classification supervised learning can be used for this task. SAS will develop the REMApp based on technical support and guidance from Co-PIs. This includes support on (1) input data sources and quality control, (2) data preprocessing, (3) model evaluation metrics, (4) sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis to improve prediction accuracy, and (5) the development of in-silico experiments to understand the role of nitrogen and phosphorus loading on red tide probabilities.
