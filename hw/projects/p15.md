## Project 5: Real-Time Decision-Making in Live Construction Projects — A Case Study Approach
This study investigates how decision-making actually unfolds on active construction projects, contrasting field realities with formal project management models. While textbooks describe linear processes, real-world decisions are often made under pressure, with incomplete information, and influenced by interpersonal dynamics. By embedding graduate students as observers and interviewers in ongoing projects, this research will document decision chains, conflict resolution methods, and adaptations to unexpected challenges.

### Key Research Questions
1.	How do key decisions (e.g., design changes, sequencing adjustments, subcontractor coordination) emerge and get approved in practice?
2.	What role do informal conversations and personal relationships play in shaping project outcomes?
3.	How do teams balance competing priorities like cost, schedule, and quality under pressure?
4.	How do decisions made in the field differ from those planned in project schedules and contracts?

### Data Collection:
-	Method:
    -	Semi-structured interviews (30–45 minutes) with project stakeholders.
    -	Direct observation of coordination meetings, site walks, and key decision moments.
    -	Collection of project artifacts (RFIs, meeting minutes, change orders) for context.
- Sample:
    - Project managers and superintendents
    - Trade foremen and subcontractor leads
    - Owners’ reps or client-side project coordinators
-	Sample size: 1–3 projects observed in depth, with 8–12 interviews per project.
-	Recruitment: Through partnerships with local contractors and project owners willing to grant site access.

### Why It’s Important:
-	Provides a rare “inside look” at how construction decisions are actually made in the field.
-	Offers evidence-based insights for improving communication, coordination, and decision documentation.
-	High relevance for both academic publications and practitioner training.

### Expected Output:
-	Narrative case studies of decision-making chains in different project contexts.
-	Comparative analysis of formal vs. informal decision-making processes.
-	Recommendations for bridging the gap between planned processes and field realities.
