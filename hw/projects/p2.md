## A model-experiment (ModEx) framework for understanding fertilizer and pesticide transport in Immokalee Groundwater

Faulty member: Ahmed S. Elshall  

### Project Summary

This project applies a Model-Experiment (ModEx) framework to study the reactive transport of fertilizers and pesticides in the groundwater system of Immokalee, FL, a key agricultural region. You will use site-specific field and lab data, including electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and other instruments ([lab details](https://aselshall.github.io/gwh/lab)), to understand subsurface hydrogeology and contaminant pathways. The project integrates EPAâ€™s HAWQS and PWC models with dye tracing experiments and aims to improve model accuracy through data collection and evaluation. Findings will support environmental health research at EPA-funded centers (BeRCH and REACT4EJ) and inform sustainable groundwater and public health management strategies in rural communities.
