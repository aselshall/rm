## AI and the Future of Higher Education

Faulty member: Ahmed S. Elshall  

### Project Summary

Building on two papers ([Published](https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2025.1596462) and [In Review](https://github.com/aselshall/rm/blob/main/hw/projects/A3_manuscript.pdf)), this project will develop a review article exploring the future of higher education in the age of generative AI. Unlike existing literature that focuses primarily on teaching tools or engineering-specific reforms (e.g., Walter, 2025, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41239-024-00448-3))), this review will take a broader, student-centered perspective.
