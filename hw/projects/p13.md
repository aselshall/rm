## Project 3: Navigating AI Anxiety in the Construction Workforce — Challenges, Remedies, and Reskilling Pathways

This study investigates how AI-related anxiety, confusion, and skepticism emerge among construction workers, especially in specialty trades, and explores strategies for building confidence, trust, and skills for effective adoption. While AI-enabled tools for scheduling, design, and safety monitoring are increasingly promoted in the construction sector, many workers feel left behind or threatened by these changes. The research will focus on capturing personal narratives, identifying the roots of AI anxiety, and proposing industry-relevant remedies such as targeted training or role redesign.

### Key Research Questions
1.	What specific AI tools or applications cause the most confusion or anxiety in the construction workforce?
2.	How do workers interpret AI’s role as a helpful assistant or as a potential replacement?
3.	What coping strategies (formal or informal) do workers and supervisors use to manage AI-driven change?
4.	What forms of training, communication, or role adaptation reduce resistance and anxiety?

### Data Collection
-	Method: Semi-structured interviews (45–60 minutes) + optional short written reflection for richer narratives.
-	Sample:
    - Specialty trade foremen (e.g., electrical, HVAC, steel)
    - Site supervisors and project engineers exposed to AI-based tools (e.g., scheduling software, AI QC systems, safety monitoring)
    - Apprentices and mid-career workers in transition
-	Sample size: 20–25 participants for thematic saturation.
-	Recruitment: Through local trade unions, contractor networks, safety training centers.

### Why It’s Important
-	AI anxiety is a barrier to productivity and innovation in construction, especially in sectors with low digital literacy.
-	Your research could produce practical recommendations for targeted reskilling and onboarding programs that reduce resistance.
-	This aligns with future-of-work and technology adoption literature, but grounds it in trade-specific field realities where AI adoption is still uneven.
-	High potential for publication in both construction management and technology adoption journals.

### Expected Output
-	Typology of AI-related anxieties in the construction sector.
-	Actionable strategies for reducing confusion and resistance which is tailored to different construction roles.
-	Framework for “AI Change Management” in construction.
