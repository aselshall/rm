<h2 style="color:blue">Understand</h2>

1. **Select a Research Topic**:
   - Choose a topic that interests you and aligns with your goals (<span style="color:red">**[Homework 1](https://github.com/aselshall/rm/blob/main/hw/hw1.md)**</span>).

2. **Conduct an Exploratory Literature Search**:
   - Refine your topic and start developing a research question (<span style="color:red">**[Homework 2](https://github.com/aselshall/rm/blob/main/hw/hw2.md)**</span>).
      - Keep your research question realistic by considering available resources, data, your skills, and time constraints.
      - Plan a timeline for implementing your research, whether it’s for the next semester’s project course or your MS thesis project.
      - Focus on a well-defined scope with achievable outcomes rather than an overly ambitious project that may lead to a dead-end.
      - Seek guidance and discuss feasibility with an expert, such as an FGCU faculty member or your course instructor.
      - Ask for help if you're uncertain about any aspect of your research.
      - Enjoy the process of learning about your problem and developing your research plan.

3. **Conduct an In-Depth Literature Review and Write the Introduction**:
   - Conduct an in-depth literature review which will form the basis of the proposal introduction (<span style="color:red">**[Homework 3](https://github.com/aselshall/rm/blob/main/hw/hw3.md)**</span>):
     - **Why** is this research important?
     - **What** has been done so far, and what do you want to contribute?
     - Refine and sharpen your research question.
     - Note: The literature review should tell a cohesive story, not just list facts. By the end, the reader should understand the topic, what has been done, and why your study is necessary to fill gaps in knowledge or provide solutions. In other words, it should identify existing research, highlight gaps, and lead to a clearly defined problem statement and research question. The literature review will form the basis of your research proposal's introduction.
   - Write the Introduction (<span style="color:red">**[Homework 4](https://github.com/aselshall/rm/blob/main/hw/hw4.md)**</span>):
      - Introduce the topic, providing necessary background information to set the context for your research.
      - Describe the research gap identified through your literature review.
      - Outline the specific research question you aim to investigate.
      - Explain the importance of this research and what it aims to contribute.
      - State the research objectives that your study seeks to achieve.
      - Detail the tasks you will undertake to address the research objectives.

4. **Method Development (How)**:
   - Develop your method with will include several components as follows (<span style="color:red">**[Homework 5](https://github.com/aselshall/rm/main/blob/hw/hw5.md)**</span>):
      - Study duration
      - Site or experiment description
      - Data and instrumentation
      - Analytical methods and procedures
      - Data analysis techniques
      - Pilot results
      - Study limitations 

6. **Proposal Development**:
   - You will integrate all these components to develop your research proposal (<span style="color:red">**[Research Proposal](https://github.com/aselshall/rm/blob/main/hw/proposal.md)**</span>):
      - Outline the “why, what, and how” of your research, including pilot results if available.
      - Define deliverables and establish criteria for measuring success.
      - Explain potential outcomes, benefits, intellectual merits, broader impacts, and address the “so what” question.
      - Provide a timeline for the project, outlining key milestones and deadlines.
      - Conduct a risk assessment, identifying potential challenges and how they will be mitigated.
      - Include a budget estimate with justifications for the resources needed (if applicable).
      - Develop a detailed data management plan.

<h2 style="color:blue">Execute</h2>

6. **Project Implementation**:
   - Carry out your research according to the plan outlined in your proposal, next semester or year in <span style="color:red">ENG 6941 Project course</span>, your <span style="color:red">MS thesis research</span>, or  <span style="color:red">start this semester</span> if you are ready.

7. **Analyze and Document Your Findings**:
   - Interpret your results, draw conclusions, and document your findings in ENG 6941 Project course or your MS thesis research.

<h2 style="color:blue">Publish</h2>

8. **Disseminate Your Findings**:
   - Present your findings at research symposiums like [Eagle-X](https://www.fgcu.edu/eaglex/) and conferences like [AGU](https://www.agu.org/annual-meeting).
   - Share your work through peer-reviewed publications, preprients, blog posts, and other platforms.
