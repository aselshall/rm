# [The Big Picture](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/big-picture)

The objective of EGN 6457 Research Methods, followed by EGN 6941 Project, is to propose and execute a research project, while improving your communication skills, both in writing and presentation. In EGN 6457 you will develop your research proposal and in EGN 6941 you will execute it and share your findings.

# EGN 6457 Research Methods
<h2 style="color:blue">Understand</h2>

**1. Select a research topic** (<span style="color:red">**[Homework 1](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/hw1)**</span>)
   - Identify a feasible project that interests you, aligns with your goals, and preferably relates to your work
      - Seek guidance and discuss feasibility with an expert, such as an FGCU faculty member, coworker, or your course instructor
      - Factors to consider in selecting a research problem include feasibility, personal interest, significance, scope, expert guidance, ethics and other factors discussed in class
   - Check [How to identify a project idea?](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/topics) for guidance including current faculty projects that you can choose from

**2. Develop a research question** (<span style="color:red">**[Homework 2](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/hw2)**</span>)
   - Conduct an exploratory literature review to refine your topic and start developing a research question
      - Keep your research problem realistic by considering available resources, data, your skills, and time constraints
      - Plan a timeline for implementing your research, whether it is for the next semester’s project course or your MS thesis
      - Focus on a well-defined scope with achievable outcomes rather than an overly ambitious project that may lead to a dead-end
      - Seek guidance and discuss details with an expert, such as an FGCU faculty member, coworker, or your course instructor
      - Ask for help if you are uncertain about any aspect of your research
      - Enjoy the process of learning about your problem and developing your research plan

**3. Write the introduction** (<span style="color:red">**[Homework 3](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/hw3)**</span>)
   - Conduct an in-depth literature review which will form the basis of the proposal introduction:
     - **Why** is this research important?
     - **What** has been done so far, and what do you want to contribute?
     - Refine and sharpen your research question
   - Write the Introduction:
      - Introduce the topic, providing necessary background information to set the context for your research
      - Describe the research gap identified through your literature review
      - Outline the specific research question you aim to investigate
      - Explain the importance of this research and what it aims to contribute
      - State the research objectives that your study seeks to achieve
      - Detail the tasks you will undertake to address the research objectives
        
   **Note:** Your introduction should tell a cohesive story, not just list facts. By the end, the reader should understand the topic, what has been done, and why your study is needed to fill knowledge gaps or provide solutions. It should identify existing research, highlight gaps, and lead to a clear problem statement with research questions and objectives.

**4. Method development** (<span style="color:red">**[Homework 4](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/hw4)**</span>)
   - **How**: Develop your method with will include several components as follows:
      - Study duration
      - Site or experiment description
      - Data and instrumentation
      - Analytical methods and procedures
      - Data analysis techniques
      - Pilot results
      - Study limitations 

**5. Proposal development** (<span style="color:red">**[Research Proposal](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/proposal-hw)**</span>)
   - You will integrate all these components to develop your research proposal:
      - Describe the “**why**, **what**, and **how**” of your research, including pilot results if available
      - Define deliverables and establish criteria for measuring success
      - Explain potential outcomes, benefits, intellectual merits, broader impacts, and address the “so what” question
      - Provide a timeline for the project, outlining key milestones and deadlines
      - Conduct a risk assessment, identifying potential challenges and how they will be mitigated
      - Cite your references using a citation management software 
      - Include a budget estimate with justifications for the resources needed (if applicable)
      - Develop a detailed data management plan

# EGN 6941 Project

<h2 style="color:blue">Execute</h2>

**6. Project implementation**
   - Begin executing your research as detailed in your proposal
   - You may  <span style="color:red">start this semester if ready</span>, and continue in the Spring semester through the <span style="color:red">ENG 6941 Project course</span> or as part of your MS thesis research.

**7. Analyze and document your findings**
   - Interpret your results, draw conclusions, and document your findings in ENG 6941 Project course or your MS thesis research

<h2 style="color:blue">Publish</h2>

**8. Disseminate your findings**
   - Present your findings to the class, at a research symposiums like [Eagle-X](https://www.fgcu.edu/eaglex/), or at a conferences like [AGU](https://www.agu.org/annual-meeting)
   - Share your work through peer-reviewed publications, preprients, blog posts, story maps, and other platforms
