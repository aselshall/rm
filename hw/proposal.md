- Proposal end date:
- Budget:
- etc.

## 2. Project Summary
#### Project Summary (*1 page*)

- Objectives (what): Research question and specific, measurable objectives
- Methods (how): Main methods and approaches to be used
- Expected Results: Major deliverables or outcomes
- Outcomes: Significance, intellectual merit, and broader impacts of the research

## 3. Introduction
#### Background and context: Why
- Provide essential information for the reader to understand and appreciate your research
  - Research area: Offer background information on the research area and its significance
  - Research site (if relevant): Detail your study site, including needs, opportunities, and threats
- Explain the motivation for your research and its importance (e.g., knowledge advancement, practical applications, transformative effects on equity)

#### Literature review: What has been done and what is needed?
- What specific problem are you going to address ?
- Summarize and critically evaluate previous related research
- Highlight gaps, inconsistencies, or areas needing further exploration
- Justify your research by clearly stating what is new

#### Problem statement: What you propose to study should be clear and new
- Formulate a clear and concise research question
- Justify the need for your research by linking it to gaps or issues identified in literature review

#### Objectives: What do I exactly want to achieve?
- List objectives that will be achieved ensuring they are specific, actionable, and measurable, directly linked to your research question

## 4. Method
#### Research design
- Describe the overall approach (e.g., qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods) and why it is suitable for addressing your research question
#### Study site/population
- Provide details about the study site, population, or sample, including any relevant characteristics or settings for your study 
#### Data collection methods
- What methods do you plan to use to collect data? (data collection procedure)
- why these methods are appropriate for your research objectives?
#### Data analysis techniques 
- How will you analyze the data? (data analysis procedure):
- Mention statistical tests, software, or analytical frameworks you will use 
- How will you validate your findings? (strategies for validating findings)
#### Ethical considerations
- What ethical issues will your study present? (anticipated ethical issues) such as informed consent, confidentiality, and potential risks to participants 

## 5. Expected Results
#### Anticipated finding and preliminary results 
- what do you expect to find based on the literature review and your research objectives
- What do preliminary results show about the practicability and value of the proposed study? (primarily pilot findings if available)

#### Deliverables
- What are the deliverables of your projects
- How will you know if  you succeed in delivering these outputs  

#### Outcomes and Impacts
- What  benefits  could  accrue  to the field and community if  the  project  is  successful 
- Outputs: Main products
- Outcomes: Specific and measurable short-term effects
- Impacts: Broader and long-term effects

## 6. Timeline
#### Research schedule 
- Show how proposed timeline aligns with the scope of the research and the resources available.
  - Milestones: major phases or stages of the research, such as data collection, analysis, and writing
  - Deliverables: Specify the outputs expected at each stage, such data sets, preliminary findings, or final reports
  - Deadlines: Assign specific deadlines to each milestone and deliverable
- Schedule generally presented table format and Gantt chart showing start and end dates of each task, and overlapping and dependent activities

#### Contingency plans
- How you plan to address potential delays or challenges, ensuring that the project can still be completed within the proposed timeframe?

## 7. References
#### Citation of sources 
- Use citation management software like Zotero to manage references and link citations directly to the reference list
- Ensure all references adhere to the required citation style (e.g., AGU)
- Generate the reference list automatically using your citation management software
-  Review the reference list carefully to ensure all entries are complete and accurate.

## 8. Appendices (if applicable)
- data management plan (required for this course)
- literature summary,
- detailed methodologies,
- survey instruments,
- consent forms,
- requested budget and budget justification,
- biosketch or CV of PI and Co-PIs,
- current and pending projects,
- letters of support,
- and any additional material that supports your proposal 

**Note:** For your research proposal in this course, a Data Management Plan is required, other items listed above are optional and as applicable.

You can download and review the sample proposal provided as a reference: [Download Sample Proposal](proposal1.pdf)  
  
This sample is useful for understanding how to structure of the Title Page, Project Summary, Introduction, Method, and Reference sections of your research proposal. For other sections, the proposal slightly deviates from the above outline as it follows the requirements of the funding agency, including a 5-page limit. For example, the timeline section is very brief. For your proposal, I expect a detailed timeline showing objectives and tasks for each objective and a clear contingency plan.
