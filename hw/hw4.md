## Homework 4: Method Development

### Objective
In Homework 3, you identified what you want to do and why you want to do it. In Homework 4, you will describe how you plan to carry out your researchâ€”your method. Here, you will detail how your research will be conducted and organized. You should clearly describe how the chemicals, procedures, or models you selected are suitable and valid to answer your research question. The method should be written in a way that allows researchers, including yourself, to follow it step-by-step, with all the necessary details to perform the research.

### Instructions

1. **Review Your Research Proposal:**
   - Reflect on the research question and objectives you developed in previous assignments. Ensure that your methodology aligns with and directly addresses these objectives.

2. **Develop the Methodology:**
   - **Study Duration:** Specify the timeline for your study. Consider how long each phase of your research will take, including data collection, analysis, and any potential revisions.
   - **Site or Experiment Description:** Provide a detailed description of the study site or experimental setup. If your research involves fieldwork, describe the location, its significance, and any relevant environmental factors. If it's a laboratory-based study, describe the experimental setup, including equipment and conditions.
   - **Data and Instrumentation:** Identify the data you will collect and the instruments or tools you will use to collect it. Be specific about the types of data (e.g., quantitative, qualitative), the instruments (e.g., sensors, surveys), and any software or tools for data collection.
   - **Analytical Methods and Procedures:** Describe the methods you will use to analyze the collected data. This may include statistical tests, modeling techniques, or qualitative analysis methods. Ensure that your chosen methods are appropriate for the type of data you will collect.
   - **Data Analysis Techniques:** Explain how you will process and interpret the data. This could involve statistical analysis, coding of qualitative data, or the use of specific software tools (e.g., Python, R, GIS). Describe how you will ensure the accuracy and reliability of your data analysis.
   - **Pilot Results:** If applicable, include any preliminary results from pilot studies or initial experiments. Discuss how these results inform the design and execution of your full study.
   - **Study Limitations:** Identify any potential limitations of your study, such as sample size, access to data, or potential biases. Discuss how you plan to mitigate these limitations or how they might affect the interpretation of your results.

3. **Reference Requirements:**
   - Ensure that any references to methodologies, tools, or analytical techniques are cited appropriately using AGU style.

### Key Points to Consider:
- Does the method section provide enough details to perform this research?
- Was the method well-thought-out and organized effectively?

### Submission:
- Submit your method section as a PDF file on Canvas by the due date indicated on Canvas.
- The late submission policy in the course syllabus applies. If you anticipate any difficulties meeting the deadline, please communicate with the instructor as early as possible.
