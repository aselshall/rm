## Homework 4: Method Development

In Homework 3 you identified what do you want to do and why do you want to do this. In Homework 4 you will describe how you want to do this, your method. Here you will tell the reader how your research will be conducted and organized. You should describe how the chemicals, procedures, or models that you chose are suitable and valid to answer your research question. The method should be written such that researchers - including you - are able to follow your method step-wise and have all the details they need to perform this research.

For homework3: 
1.	Read the materials in Module 5 on Canvas:  The materials under the heading “(5) Materials and Methods”, which we will cover in class will help you to write the method section
2.	Prepare a draft of your method section:   Follow the suggestions and tips provided in the “Materials and Methods.pptx” in Module 5 on Canvas. 
3.	Discuss your method in class with your work being critiqued: You will provide a 20-minute PowerPoint presentation to the class, and allow 5-10 minutes for discussion and questions. You can present on Nov 29 or Dec 1, and we will have a maximum of three presentation per class. Book your data and time early and first come first served.
4.	Optional: I highly encourage you to have at least one meeting with me to discuss your progress

Your grade breakdown:
- A draft of your method (3 points). Although this is a draft of your method section, try to make this draft as complete and thorough as you can because you will not have much time to revise the method section. Your research proposal is due by Thursday Dec 15. The grading criteria are:
  - Does the method section provide enough details to perform this research?
  - Was the method thought over and is well organized?
- Class presentation as described above (2 points as assessed by your peers similar to homework 3). See the presentation rubric that is attached with homework 4.
