# [Homework 2: Develop a research question](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/hw2)

## Objective
To get started with developing a clear and focused research question by conducting an exploratory literature search on a topic of your interest. This homework will help you understand the current landscape of your research problem, identify gaps in knowledge, and lay the foundation for your research proposal. This will also help you to prepare for your [first class presentation](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/class-presentation1).

## Instructions

**1. Review your chosen research topic**
- Reflect on the research problem you identified in [Homework 1](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/hw1)
- Consider the feedback you received and think about how you might refine and narrow your topic

**2. Conduct an exploratory literature search**
- Use academic databases such as *Web of Science*, *Google Scholar*, or discipline-specific databases to search for literature related to your topic
- Identify and read a variety of sources including journal articles, review articles, authoritative books, and other relevant sources
- Take detailed notes on:
  - Key findings and concepts
  - Current trends and developments
  - Methods commonly used
  - Identified gaps or controversies in the existing research

**3. Identify a research gap**
- Analyze your findings to pinpoint areas that have not been extensively studied or questions that remain unanswered
- Consider the significance of addressing this gap and how it could contribute to your field

**4. Formulate your research question**
- Develop a clear, focused, and researchable question that addresses the identified gap
- Ensure the question is specific and concise, avoiding overly broad or narrow scope
- Reflect on the feasibility, considering factors such as available data, resources, and time constraints

**5. Write a 2-3 page summary**
- Introduction:
  - Briefly introduce your chosen topic and its relevance
- Literature review summary:
  - Summarize the key themes, findings, and gaps identified from your literature search
- Research gap and question:
  - Clearly state the research gap you identified
  - Present your formulated research question
- Significance and feasibility:
  - Discuss the importance of your research question and its potential impact
  - Reflect on the feasibility and scope, including any anticipated challenges and how you might address them
- Conclusion:
  - Conclude with how this research question sets the stage for your future research work

**6. Formatting guidelines**
- Length: 2-3 pages single space, excluding references.
- References: Include a reference list citing all sources consulted during your literature search, formatted according to American Geophysical Union (AGU) style 

## Submission
- Submit your PDF on Canvas by the due date
- Follow the [late submission policy](https://aselshall.github.io/rm#late-assignment-and-report-policy) as outlined in the course syllabus
- Contact the instructor early if you anticipate any issues with meeting the deadline

## Rubric

| **Criteria**               | **Exemplary (95-100%)**                       | **Proficient (90-94%)**                   | **Adequate (85-89%)**                     | **Needs Improvement (75-84%)**            | **Incomplete (<75%)**                     | **Weight** |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Literature Search**       | Identifies 12+ relevant, current sources, shows excellent understanding of the topic. | Identifies 8-11 relevant, current sources, shows good understanding. | Identifies 5-7 relevant sources, understanding lacks depth. | Identifies fewer than 5 sources, understanding is weak. | No sources identified or irrelevant sources. | 30%       |
| **Research Gap**            | Clearly identifies a significant and original gap, critically analyzes at least 3 sources supporting the gap. | Identifies a relevant gap, analyzes 2-3 sources. | Identifies a gap but with limited analysis, based on 1-2 sources. | Gap is vague, not well-supported by sources. | No gap identified or poorly supported. | 20%       |
| **Research Question**       | Well-formulated, clear, and focused; directly ties to the gap. Question is novel and actionable. | Clear and focused question, somewhat linked to the gap. | Question is present but may be too broad or narrow, with unclear relevance to the gap. | Unclear or poorly formulated research question. | No research question provided. | 25%       |
| **Significance & Feasibility** | Provides 3+ strong reasons for significance, demonstrates feasibility with specific details (e.g., timeline, resources). | Provides 2-3 reasons for significance, addresses feasibility with some detail. | Provides 1-2 reasons for significance, addresses feasibility but lacks depth. | Weak or vague discussion of significance, limited feasibility consideration. | No discussion of significance or feasibility. | 15%       |
| **Clarity & Organization**  | Clear, logical flow of ideas, no more than 1-2 minor errors (grammar, formatting). | Mostly clear and organized, with 3-5 minor errors. | Some organization issues, contains 6-8 errors that affect clarity. | Disorganized, more than 8 errors, difficult to follow. | Disorganized, many errors, hard to understand. | 10%       |

## Next steps
This assignment lays the groundwork for your upcoming [research proposal](https://https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/proposal-hw) by helping you establish a strong and focused research question. In [Homework 3](https://https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/hw3), you will conduct a more in-depth literature review to refine your research questions, develop objectives, and begin developing the introduction section of your proposal based on the foundation you have built here.
