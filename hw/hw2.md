## Homework 2: Conducting an exploratory literature search and refining your research topic

### Objective
This assignment aims to guide you through the process of refining your chosen research topic into a research question. By conducting an exploratory literature search, you will develop a clearer understanding of the research landscape, identify gaps in existing knowledge, and formulate your research question accordingly.

### Instructions

1. **Review Your Chosen Research Topic**:
   - Reflect on the research problem you identified in Homework 1. Consider the feedback you received and think about how you might refine and narrow your topic.

2. **Conduct an Exploratory Literature Search**:
   - Perform an initial literature search using academic databases (e.g., Web of Science, or Google Scholar) to gather information on your topic.
   - Identify key studies, review papers, and current trends related to your research problem. 
   - Take notes on how other researchers have approached similar problems and consider how your research might contribute to the field.

3. **Formulate Your Research Question**:
   - Based on your literature search, refine your research problem into a specific research question.
   - Ensure your research question is clear, focused, and feasible given the resources, time, and data available to you.
   - Consider the scope of your research: Is your question too broad, too narrow, or just right? Make adjustments as necessary.

4. **Reflect on Feasibility and Scope**:
   - Evaluate whether your research question is realistic given your current skills, resources, and the time available for your project.
   - Plan a basic timeline or outline of how you would approach answering this research question. Consider what data you would need, how you would collect it, and what methodologies you might use.
   - If you are unsure about the feasibility, seek guidance from your instructor or faculty advisor.

5. **Write a 1-Page Summary**:
   - Write a concise 1-page summary that includes the following:
     - A brief overview of the key findings from your exploratory literature search.
     - Your refined research question.
     - A reflection on why this research question is significant and how it fits within the current research landscape.
     - A preliminary plan outlining how you might address this research question, including considerations of feasibility and scope.

### Submission
- Submit your homework as a PDF file on the Canvas page by the due date indicated on Canvas.
- The late submission policy in the course syllabus applies. If you anticipate any difficulties meeting the deadline, please communicate with the instructor as early as possible.

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Depth of Research**: Did you conduct a thorough literature search that reveals a good understanding of the current research landscape?
- **Research Question**: Is your research question clear and well-defined?
- **Feasibility and Scope**: Have you thoughtfully considered the feasibility and scope of your research question?
- **Clarity and Organization**: Is your summary well-written, logically organized, and free of errors?

### Next Step
This assignment is designed to build on the foundation you established in [Homework 1](https://github.com/aselshall/rm/edit/main/hw/hw1.md), helping you progress from a broad topic to a specific, actionable research question. This assigment sets the stage for [Homework 3](https://github.com/aselshall/rm/edit/main/hw/hw3.md), where you will conduct an in-depth literature review to refine your research question and start drafting the introduction section of your research proposal.
