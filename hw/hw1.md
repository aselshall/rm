# Homework 1: Select a research topic

## Choose your topic
- Select a research topic in civil and environmental engineering that interests you and can be completed within the scope of the project course or thesis as described in [the big picture](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/big-picture).
- Preferably choose a project that relates to your job or work.
- For guidance, refer to [How to Find a Project Idea?](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/topics) that also includes current faculty projects as potential research topics.

## Get expert guidance
- It is recommended to seek advice from an expert, such as an FGCU faculty member, a coworker with relevant expertise, or your course instructor, to discuss the feasibility and scope of your chosen topic.
- If you decide to proceed without an advisor, mention this in your submission and explain how you will manage the research on your own.
  
## Consider key factors:
Review the factors discussed in Lesson 3: Research Problem, such as:
- Feasibility: Can the project be completed with the resources and time available?
- Personal interest: Does the topic genuinely interest you and motivate you? Why does this problem interest you? How would your interest in this topic help sustain your work or advance your career? 
- Significance: Why is this research problem important? What potential impact could exploring this problem have? 
- Scope: Is the scope of the research appropriate for the project course or thesis research?
- Ethics: Are there any ethical considerations or challenges?
- Other Factors: Consider any other relevant factors from the lesson.
Ensure that your topic aligns with these factors to maximize the potential success of your research.

## Write your reflection
In 1-2 pages, describe your chosen research topic and explain how you considered the factors listed above.

## Submit your work
- Submit your PDF on Canvas by the due date.
- Follow the [late submission policy](https://github.com/aselshall/rm/blob/main/README.md#late-assignment-and-report-policy) as outlined in the course syllabus.
- Contact the instructor early if you anticipate any issues with meeting the deadline.

## Rubric
In open-ended assignments like this, a rubric is suggestive. The rubric mainly provides general guidelines, so that you do not miss key points. However, grading may also consider the overall quality, creativity, and depth of your work beyond strict adherence to the rubric.

| **Criteria**                     | **Excellent (90-100%)**               | **Good (80-89%)**              | **Satisfactory (70-79%)**       | **Needs Improvement (60-69%)**  | **Poor (<60%)**                | **Weight** |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------|
| **Topic Selection**              | Clear, and feasible topic  | Mostly feasible  | Seems feasible, but may lack clarity | Relevant topic, but does not seem feasible    | Irrelevant or not feasible    | 30%       |
| **Expert Guidance**              | Thoughtfully Consider or plan for guidance |  Consider or plan for guidance      | Mention guidance or plan for guidance    | Little mention of guidance, or unclear plan   | No mention or plan            | 30%       |
| **Key Factors**                  | Addresses key factors thoroughly     | Addresses most key factors    | Addresses some key factors     | Mentions few key factors       | Does not address key factors  | 30%       |
| **Clarity and Organization**     | Clear, well-organized, few errors    | Mostly clear, minor errors    | Somewhat clear, some errors    | Unclear, disorganized, errors  | Very unclear, many errors     | 10%       |
