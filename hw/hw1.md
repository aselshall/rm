# [Homework 1: Identify a research topic](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/hw1)

## Objective
The first step in developing your [research proposal](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/proposal-hw) is to identify a feasible topic that interests you.

## Instructions

**1. Identify your topic (20%)**
- Identify a research topic in civil and environmental engineering that interests you and can be completed within the scope of the project course as described in [the big picture](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/big-picture).
- For guidance, refer to [How to Find a Project Idea?](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/topics) that also includes current faculty projects as potential research topics.
- Preferably choose a project that relates to your job or work.
  
**2. Get expert guidance (50%)**
- You must  have an FGCU faculty member as your primary supervisor.
- You may have multiple research supervisors, including external ones.
- Your primary supervisor must be an FGCU faculty member with Canvas access to track your progress, provide ongoing support, and grade your work.
- If you are a Construction Management student planning to work with an external supervisor, please designate Dr. Anh Chau or Dr. Jieyi Bao as your primary supervisor.
- Your primary supervisor may have a busy schedule, so be sure to contact your primary supervisor as early as possible, and discuss your project with them. 
- You need to to discuss the feasibility and scope of your chosen topic with your primary supervisor.
- Your primary supervisor must approve your project and scope before you proceed. This ensures the project is feasible and aligned with the course learning objectives.

**3. Consider key factors (20%)**    
Review the factors discussed in Lesson 3: Research Problem, such as:
- Feasibility: Can the project be completed with the resources and time available, and given my skill set? 
- Personal interest: Does the topic genuinely interest you and motivate you? Why does this problem interest you? How would your interest in this topic help sustain your work or advance your career? 
- Significance: Why is this research problem important? What potential impact could exploring this problem have? 
- Scope: Is the scope of the research appropriate for the project course or thesis research?
- Ethics: Are there any ethical considerations or challenges?
- Other Factors: Consider any other relevant factors from the lesson.  

Ensure that your topic aligns with these factors to maximize the potential success of your research.

**4. Write your reflection (10%)**
- In 1-2 pages, describe your chosen research topic and explain how you considered the factors listed above. Your objective is to convince the reader that your proposed research is useful, and that you have the neeeded skills, guidance, resources, and time to complete it successfully, and not just talk about it. Use the rubric below for guidance.

## Submission
- Submit your PDF on Canvas by the due date.
- Follow the [late submission policy](https://aselshall.github.io/rm#late-assignment-and-report-policy) as outlined in the course syllabus.
- Contact the instructor early if you anticipate any issues with meeting the deadline.

## Rubric
In open-ended homework like this, a rubric is suggestive. The rubric mainly provides general guidelines, so that you do not miss key points. However, grading may also consider the overall quality, creativity, and depth of your work beyond strict adherence to the rubric.

| **Criteria**                     | **Excellent (90-100%)**               | **Good (80-89%)**              | **Satisfactory (70-79%)**       | **Needs Improvement (60-69%)**  | **Poor (<60%)**                | **Weight** |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------|
| **Topic Selection**              | Clear, and feasible topic  | Mostly feasible  | Seems feasible, but may lack clarity | Relevant topic, but does not seem feasible    | Irrelevant or not feasible    | 20%       |
| **Expert Guidance** | - An FGCU faculty member is designated as the primary supervisor <br> - Student has extensively discussed feasibility and scope of the project with primary supervisor <br> - Project and scope have been approved by primary supervisor | - An FGCU faculty member is designated as the primary supervisor <br> - Student has discussed feasibility and scope of the project with primary supervisor <br> - Approval or scope is somehow clear | - An FGCU faculty member is designated as the primary supervisor <br> - Some evidence of discussion, but approval or scope not fully clear | - FGCU faculty name mentioned, but unclear if project feasibility has been discussed | - No FGCU faculty supervisor listed <br> - No guidance, discussion, or approval | 50%        |
| **Key Factors**                  | Addresses key factors thoroughly     | Addresses most key factors    | Addresses some key factors     | Mentions few key factors       | Does not address key factors  | 20%       |
| **Clarity and Organization**     | Clear, well-organized, few errors    | Mostly clear, minor errors    | Somewhat clear, some errors    | Unclear, disorganized, errors  | Very unclear, many errors     | 10%       |

## Next steps
This assignment lays the groundwork for your [research proposal](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/proposal-hw) by helping you to choose a topic.  In [Homework 2](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/hw2), you will conduct an exploratory literature review to identify gaps and develop your research questions.
