## Homework 1: Identifying key considerations in choosing a research problem

### Objective
This assignment aims to help you apply the key factors involved in selecting a research problem for a research project or MS thesis in water resources and environmental engineering.

### Instructions

1. Select a broad area within water resources or environmental engineering that interests you. [Here are some strategies](https://github.com/aselshall/rm/blob/main/M2/topics.md) to help you find a project idea.

2. Based on the broad topic, think of a specific research problem that you might want to explore. Keep it simple and focus on what you find intriguing.

3. For the research problem youâ€™ve identified, briefly consider the following:
   - Significance: Why is this research problem important? What potential impact could exploring this problem have?
   - Feasibility: Do you think this problem is manageable given the resources, time, and data you might have access to?
   - Personal Interest: Why does this problem interest you? How would your interest in this topic help sustain your work?
   - Ethical Considerations: Are there any ethical issues related to studying this problem? How might you address them?

4. In a 1-page reflection, describe the research problem you have chosen and explain how you considered each of the above factors in your choice. 

### Submission
Submit your reflection on Canvas page in PDF format by by the due date on Canvas. [Late submission policy](https://github.com/aselshall/rm/blob/main/README.md#late-assignment-and-report-policy) in the course syllabus applies.

### Evaluation Criteria 
- Understanding: Does the reflection show a basic understanding of the importance of significance, feasibility, personal interest, and ethics in selecting a research problem?
- Application: How well did the you apply these considerations to your chosen research problem?
- Clarity: Is the reflection clear, well-organized, and free of errors?
