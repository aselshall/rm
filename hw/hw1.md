## Homework 1: Development of research topic

### Objective
As described in [the big picture](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/big-picture), this assignment aims to help you apply the key factors involved in selecting a research problem for a research project or MS thesis in civil and environmental engineering.

### Instructions
1. Clearfully review the slides from Lesson 3, "Research Problem".
   
2. Select a broad area within civil and environmental engineering that interests you. You may refer to these [strategies for finding a project idea](https://github.com/aselshall/rm/blob/main/hw/topics.md).

3. Based on the broad topic, think of a specific research problem that you might want to explore. Keep it simple!
   
5. For the research problem you have identified, briefly consider the following:
   - Significance: Why is this research problem important? What potential impact could exploring this problem have?
   - Feasibility: Do you think this problem is manageable given the resources, time, and data you might have access to?
   - Personal Interest: Why does this problem interest you? How would your interest in this topic help sustain your work or advance your career?
   - Other Factors: Consider any other relevant factors listed in the Lesson 3 slides

6. In a 1-page reflection, describe the research problem you have chosen and explain how you considered each of the above factors in your choice. 

### Submission
- Submit your homework on Canvas page in PDF format by by the due date on Canvas.
- The [late submission policy](https://github.com/aselshall/rm/blob/main/README.md#late-assignment-and-report-policy) in the course syllabus applies.
- It is essential to adhere to the deadlines to ensure fairness and maintain the integrity of the learning process. If you encounter challenges that may affect your ability to submit on time, please communicate with the instructor as early as possible to explore possible accommodations.

### Evaluation Criteria 
- Understanding: Does the reflection show a basic understanding of the importance of significance, feasibility, personal interest, ethics, and other factors in selecting a research problem?
- Clarity: Is the reflection clear, well-organized, and free of errors?

|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Understanding**           | Demonstrates a thorough understanding of the importance of significance, feasibility, personal interest, ethics, and other factors in selecting a research problem. Insightfully applies these considerations to the chosen research problem. | Shows a good understanding of the key factors involved in selecting a research problem, with appropriate application to the chosen research problem. | Displays a basic understanding of significance, feasibility, personal interest, and ethics, with some application to the chosen research problem. | Shows a limited understanding of the key factors, with minimal application to the chosen research problem. | Lacks understanding of the key factors in selecting a research problem, with little or no application to the chosen research problem. | 40%       |
| **Significance and Feasibility** | Clearly articulates the significance and feasibility of the research problem, providing a compelling rationale for its importance and manageability. | Articulates the significance and feasibility of the research problem, with a clear rationale. | Provides a basic rationale for the significance and feasibility of the research problem, but may lack depth or clarity. | Offers a weak or unclear rationale for the significance and feasibility of the research problem. | Fails to address the significance and feasibility of the research problem or provides an inadequate rationale. | 25%       |
| **Personal Interest** | Effectively explains personal interest in the research problem. | Explains personal interest in the research problem. | Provides a basic explanation of personal interest, but may lack depth. | Offers a weak explanation of personal interest. | Fails to explain personal interest. | 20%       |
| **Clarity and Organization** | The reflection is exceptionally clear, well-organized, and free of errors, making the argument easy to follow. | The reflection is clear and organized, with minor errors that do not detract from the overall argument. | The reflection is somewhat clear but may lack organization or have multiple errors, making the argument less compelling. | The reflection lacks clarity, is poorly organized, and contains multiple errors, making it difficult to follow. | The reflection is unclear, disorganized, and riddled with errors, rendering the argument incoherent. | 15%       |
| **Total Weight**            |                                                                   |                                                                 |                                                                 |                                                                  |                                                                   | **100%**   |
