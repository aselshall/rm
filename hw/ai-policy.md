## Generative AI Policy

Responsible use of GenAI (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Consensus) is expected and you must critically evaluate and fact-check generated content. If you used GenAI, you must provide a GenAI Statement clearly stating how and when you used AI and which tools you used. Violations will be treated as academic dishonesty and will be subject to [Policy for Academic Integrity Violations](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/#policy-for-academic-integrity-violations). 

## Example of GenAI Statement

This paper ([Elshall and Badir, 2025](https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2025.1596462)) provides an example for GenAI Statement:

> **Generative AI statement**    
> The authors declare that Gen AI was used in the creation of this manuscript. Data analysis and plotting was conducted using standard Python packages including Pandas and Matplotlib with code generation assistance from GTP-4o and GPT3.5 Turbo via Jupyter AI. AI assistance from GPT-4o was utilized for providing review comments, refining text for succinctness and clarity, providing suggestions for restructuring paragraphs to improve logic flow, and performing semantic analysis of qualitative survey responses. For the literature review, ChatGPT-4o, Gemini Pro 2.5 and Perplexity (ChatGPT-4o) were used to develop ideas and synthesize content. Consensus Pro Analysis and ChatGPT-4o web search features were used to identify several sources. AI contributions were verified and contextualized to ensure accuracy and relevance to the study's objectives.
