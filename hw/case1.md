### Questions

In the movie *Erin Brockovich*, the protagonist uncovers a major environmental health issue involving contaminated groundwater in a small community. These questions are designed to challenge your thinking and deepen your understanding of research methods by applying them to a real-world case study. The goal is to help you see how the concepts and techniques you have learned in class can be utilized to address complex environmental issues. This exercise encourages you to think critically, make connections between theory and practice, and gain a more nuanced perspective on the role of research in environmental problem-solving. Watch the movie and answer these questions. 

1. **Research problem:** Based on the events depicted in the movie, describe the environmental research problem that Erin Brockovich investigated. How did the contamination affect the community, and what were the main concerns that needed to be addressed?

2. **Research approach:** Carefully study the "Research approaches (world views)" slide in "Lesson 2 Research Paradigms". Based on the research approaches outlined in the table, what approach that best aligns with the Erin Brockovich case? Explain your answer with respect to the five criteria in the table.
  
3. **Research design:** Carefully study the "Alterative research designs: Examples" slide in "Lesson 2 Research Paradigms" including the slide notes. If you were tasked with conducting a formal environmental research study on the groundwater contamination issue presented in the movie, what research design would you choose (e.g., experimental design, case study, convergent)? Justify your choice.

4. **Literature review:** What are the key sources of information you would review to understand the context of groundwater contamination? Describe how you would approach the literature review to gain a comprehensive understanding of the historical, scientific, and regulatory aspects of the contamination issue. 

5. **Data collection and analysis:** Discuss the types of data (qualitative and/or quantitative) you would need to collect for a comprehensive understanding of the contamination issue. Describe the specific data collection methods (e.g., water sampling, health surveys, archival research, etc.) you would use and explain how you would ensure the reliability and validity of the data collected. Then, outline how you would analyze this data to draw meaningful conclusions, including any statistical or thematic analysis techniques that would be most appropriate for this research.

6. **Ethical considerations:** Discuss the ethical issues involved in conducting research in a community affected by environmental contamination. What steps would you take to ensure that the research is conducted ethically and that the communityâ€™s well-being is prioritized?

7. **Impact Assessment:** How would you assess the long-term impact of the contamination on the health of the community? What measures would you recommend to mitigate these impacts?

8. **Deliverables, outputs, outcomes, and impacts:** 
    - Deliverables: Identify the specific products or reports you would generate from your research, such as a detailed groundwater contamination report, health impact assessment, court case, or policy recommendations.
    - Outputs: Describe the immediate results of your research, such as increased community awareness, identification of the contamination sources, or publication of research findings.
    - Outcomes: Discuss the short-term and medium-term effects of your research, such as improvements in community health, changes in local policies, or remediation efforts initiated by government agencies.
    - Impacts: Explain the long-term impacts your research could have on the community and the broader field of environmental health, such as lasting improvements in public health, changes in environmental regulations, or contributions to the body of scientific knowledge on contamination and its effects.


## Submission 
- Answer the above questions in a concise 2-3 page reflection.
- Be sure to integrate concepts from your course material.
- Your response should demonstrate an understanding of both the movie's narrative and the application of environmental research methodologies.
