### Questions

In the movie *Erin Brockovich*, the protagonist uncovers a major environmental health issue involving contaminated groundwater in a small community. These questions are designed to challenge your thinking and deepen your understanding of research methods by applying them to a real-world case study. The goal is to help you see how the concepts and techniques you will learn in class can be utilized to address complex environmental issues. Refer to <span style="color:blue">Module 1: Introduction to Research Methods course</span> and the [big picture](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/big-picture) for details. This exercise encourages you to think critically, make connections between theory and practice, and gain a more nuanced perspective on the role of research in problem-solving. Watch the movie and answer these questions. 

1. **Research problem:** Refer to <span style="color:blue">Module 2: Foundations of research</span>. Based on the movie *Erin Brockovich*, describe the environmental research problem investigated. How did the groundwater contamination impact the community, and what were the main concerns?

2. **Research approach:** In <span style="color:blue">Module 2: Foundations of research</span>, review the "Research approaches (worldviews)" slide from "Lesson 2: Research Paradigms". Which research approach aligns best with the Erin Brockovich case? Justify your answer using the five criteria provided in the slide.

3. **Research design:** In <span style="color:blue">Module 2: Foundations of research</span>, examine the "Alternative research designs: Examples" slide from "Lesson 2: Research Paradigms". If you were to conduct a formal study on the groundwater contamination issue in the movie, which research design would you choose (e.g., experimental design, case study, convergent)? Explain your choice.

4. **Literature review:** Refer to <span style="color:blue">Module 3: Literature review</span>. Identify key sources you would review to understand the context of groundwater contamination. How would you approach the literature review to gain a comprehensive understanding of the historical, scientific, and regulatory aspects?

5. **Method:** Refer to <span style="color:blue">Module 4: Laboratory methods</span> and <span style="color:blue">Module 5: Method development</span>. Discuss the types of data (qualitative and/or quantitative) you would collect to understand the contamination issue. Describe the specific data collection methods (e.g., water sampling, health surveys) you would use, and how you would ensure the reliability and validity of the data. Then, outline how you would analyze the data, including any relevant statistical or thematic techniques.

6. **Ethical considerations:** Refer to <span style="color:blue">Module 6: Ethics in research and publishing</span>. Explore the ethical issues in conducting research within a community affected by environmental contamination. What steps would you take to ensure ethical conduct and prioritize the communityâ€™s well-being? What ethical forms or approvals would you need?

7. **Expected results:**
Refer to <span style="color:blue">Module 7: Expected results</span>. Outline the expected deliverables, outputs, outcomes, and impacts of your research.
    - Deliverables: Identify the specific products or reports you would generate from your research, such as a detailed groundwater contamination report, health impact assessment, court case, or policy recommendations.
    - Outputs: Describe the immediate results of your research, such as increased community awareness, identification of the contamination sources, or publication of research findings.
    - Outcomes: Discuss the short-term and medium-term effects of your research, such as improvements in community health, changes in local policies, or remediation efforts initiated by government agencies.
    - Impacts: Explain the long-term impacts your research could have on the community and the broader field of environmental health, such as lasting improvements in public health, changes in environmental regulations, or contributions to the body of scientific knowledge on contamination and its effects.

8. **Impact assessment:** In the ENG 6941 Project course or your MS thesis research you are expected to conduct the research that you proposed including the process of analyzing results, discussing their implications, and drawing conclusions. Refer to <span style="color:blue">Module 8: Interpreting and reporting research findings</span>. How would you assess the long-term impact of the contamination on community health? What measures would you recommend to mitigate these impacts?

### Submission 
- Answer the above questions in a concise 2-3 page reflection.
- Be sure to integrate concepts from your course material.
- Your response should demonstrate an understanding of both the movie's narrative and the application of environmental research methodologies.
