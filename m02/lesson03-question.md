##  Developing Researchable Questions in Water Resources and Environmental Engineering

**Learning Objectives:**

* Students will be able to differentiate between researchable and non-researchable questions.
* Students will be able to formulate strong, researchable questions relevant to water resources and environmental engineering.
* Students will understand the importance of focusing research questions.

**Introduction:**

The foundation of any successful research project is a well-defined, researchable question. A strong research question guides your investigation, focuses your data collection, and ultimately shapes the conclusions you can draw from your work. 

**What Makes a Question Researchable?**

A researchable question is:

* **Specific:**  Clearly defined and focused on a particular aspect of the topic.
* **Measurable:**  Can be investigated through data collection and analysis.
* **Attainable:**  Feasible to research within the given constraints of time, resources, and available data.
* **Relevant:** Addresses a significant issue within the field of water resources and environmental engineering. 
* **Original:** Contributes new knowledge or insights to the existing body of research.

**Researchable vs. Non-Researchable Questions:**

Let's take the topic of **"Climate Change and Water Resources"**.  Here's a breakdown of non-researchable and researchable questions:

**Non-Researchable** | **Researchable** | **Why?**
------- | -------- | --------
Is climate change bad for water resources? | How does projected climate change impact groundwater recharge rates in the Southwestern United States? |  The first question is too broad and subjective. The second question is specific, measurable, and focused on a particular region and aspect of water resources.
What is the best way to solve the water crisis? | What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing rainwater harvesting systems in urban areas to mitigate the impacts of drought? | The first question is too vague and subjective. The second question focuses on a specific solution and its measurable impacts.
Should we build more dams? | How do dam operations affect downstream aquatic ecosystems in terms of flow regime and sediment transport? | The first question is based on opinion and values. The second question explores a specific impact of dams that can be measured and studied. 

**Examples in Water Resources and Environmental Engineering:**

**Topic:** Wastewater Treatment

* **Non-researchable:** Is wastewater treatment important? (Too broad, subjective)
* **Researchable:** What is the effectiveness of constructed wetlands in removing nitrogen and phosphorus from municipal wastewater? (Specific, measurable, focused)

**Topic:**  Water Quality

* **Non-researchable:** What is the best way to ensure clean water for everyone? (Too broad, idealistic)
* **Researchable:** How do agricultural land use practices affect the concentration of pesticides in surface water runoff? (Specific, measurable, focuses on a particular source of pollution)

**Activity:**

1. **Brainstorming:** Have students brainstorm research topics within water resources and environmental engineering that interest them.
2. **Formulating Questions:**  For each topic, have students formulate both non-researchable and researchable questions. Encourage discussion and debate about what makes a question suitable for research.
3. **Refining Questions:** Guide students to refine their researchable questions, ensuring they are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and original. 

**Conclusion:**

Crafting a strong, researchable question is the first crucial step in any research endeavor. By understanding the characteristics of researchable questions, students can develop focused and impactful research projects that contribute to the advancement of water resources and environmental engineering.
