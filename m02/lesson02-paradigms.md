## 5E Instructional Model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate)

### Objective:
Students will understand various research approaches and designs, their applications, and how to select an appropriate approach and design for their research projects.

### Engage:
Capture students' interest and stimulate their thinking (example question and discussion).

### Explore:
Allow students to investigate the topic (small group and case studies).

### Explain:
Provide a detailed explanation of the concept.
- Qualitative Research:  Methods, data collection techniques (interviews, focus groups), analysis, and applications.
- Quantitative Research: Experimental design, surveys, statistical analysis, and applications.
- Mixed-Methods Research: Combining qualitative and quantitative methods, benefits, and challenges.

### Elaborate:
Extend students' understanding and allow them to apply what they have learned.
- Each group will select a topic, formulate research questions, choose an appropriate research approach and methodology, and explain their choice of research approach and its relevance to their research questions.

### Evaluate:
Assess students' understanding and provide feedback.
- Ask students how they can apply this knowledge to their own research projects.

## Research Approaches

### Postpositivism (causes determine effects): Theory Verification
- **Postpositivism** is grounded in the belief that reality can be objectively observed and measured, and that causes lead to specific effects.
- **Example**: In groundwater sustainability, studying how various land use practices (causes) affect groundwater recharge rates (effects).
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Determination**: Researchers aim to determine specific factors that influence groundwater levels, such as precipitation rates, land use, and agricultural practices.
  - **Reductionism**: Complex issues are broken down into simpler, measurable components, such as nitrate concentration, water table levels, and withdrawal rates.
  - **Empirical Observation and Measurement**: Data collection through empirical methods, like monitoring groundwater levels or analyzing water samples.
  - **Theory Verification**: The goal is to test and verify existing theories using empirical data.
  - **Example**: Testing the "safe yield" theory of groundwater management by collecting data on groundwater recharge rates, extraction rates, and aquifer levels.

### Constructivism (participants’ views): Theory Generation
- **Constructivism** emphasizes understanding the perspectives and experiences of individuals or communities.
- **Example**: In groundwater sustainability, exploring how different communities perceive and value groundwater resources.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Understanding**: The focus is on how local communities perceive groundwater sustainability.
  - **Multiple Participant Meanings**: Exploring diverse perspectives from stakeholders like farmers, policymakers, and residents.
  - **Social and Historical Construction**: Knowledge is shaped by social, cultural, and historical contexts.
  - **Theory Generation**: Constructivist research generates new theories based on shared values and local knowledge.
  - **Example**: Developing the "Community-based groundwater management" theory.

### Transformative (addressing marginalized individuals): Change-Oriented (Theory)
- **Transformative Paradigm** is concerned with social justice and empowering marginalized groups.
- **Example**: In groundwater sustainability, ensuring underrepresented communities have access to clean and sustainable groundwater resources.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Political**: Research focuses on the political dynamics of groundwater management.
  - **Power and Justice Oriented**: The aim is to address inequalities in groundwater access.
  - **Collaborative**: Involves collaboration with marginalized communities to co-create equitable solutions.
  - **Change-Oriented**: The goal is to create positive social change, such as advocating for laws that protect vulnerable communities.
  - **Example**: Developing the "equity-driven groundwater allocation" theory.

### Pragmatism (concern with applications, what works, and solutions to problems): Real-World Practice-Oriented (Theory)
- **Pragmatism** is focused on finding practical solutions to real-world problems.
- **Example**: In groundwater sustainability, developing and implementing effective groundwater management practices.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Consequences of Actions**: Evaluating the consequences of different groundwater management strategies.
  - **Problem-Centered**: Driven by the need to solve specific problems like over-extraction or contamination.
  - **Pluralistic**: Embraces multiple methods and approaches.
  - **Real-World Practice Oriented**: Focuses on what works in practice.
  - **Example**: Developing the "adaptive groundwater management" theory.

## Research Methods

### Quantitative Approach:
- Involves pre-determined, instrument-based questions designed to collect performance, attitude, observational, and census data, subjected to statistical analysis and interpretation.

### Qualitative Approach:
- Utilizes both pre-determined and emerging methods, incorporating open- and closed-ended questions to gather a variety of data forms, analyzed through statistical and text-based methods.

### Mixed Methods Approach:
- Combines emerging methodologies with open-ended questions to collect and analyze interview, observation, document, and audiovisual data, employing text and image analysis.

## Examples of Research Designs

### Quantitative:
- **Experimental Designs**: A randomized controlled experiment to test the effectiveness of different recharge techniques on groundwater levels.
- **Nonexperimental Designs**: A correlational study examining the relationship between agricultural practices and nitrate levels in groundwater.
- **Longitudinal Designs**: A long-term study tracking the impact of urbanization on groundwater recharge rates over several decades.

### Qualitative:
- **Narrative Research**: Interviews with farmers to collect stories about their experiences with groundwater depletion.
- **Phenomenology**: Exploring the lived experiences of residents in a community where groundwater contamination has occurred.
- **Grounded Theory**: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to develop a grounded theory on the factors influencing groundwater management.
- **Ethnographies**: Studying a rural community’s water use practices and how cultural beliefs influence groundwater conservation.
- **Case Study**: In-depth analysis of a region where groundwater management practices have successfully addressed water scarcity.

### Mixed Methods:
- **Convergent**: Combining quantitative and qualitative data to analyze groundwater sustainability challenges.
- **Explanatory Sequential**: Collecting quantitative data first, then qualitative data to explain patterns observed.
- **Exploratory Sequential**: Starting with qualitative interviews, then designing a quantitative survey to measure attitudes and behaviors.
- **Complex Designs with Embedded Core Designs**: Embedding a qualitative case study within a broader quantitative survey of groundwater management practices.
