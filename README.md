#### Laboratory Methods Classes

- Format: In-person, off-campus at the Emergent Technologies Institute (ETI)
- Schedule: M/W, 4:30–5:45 PM
- Location: 16301 Innovation Ln, Fort Myers, FL 33913
- Instructor: Huan Luong, Research Laboratory Manager

  - Email: [hluong@fgcu.edu](mailto:hluong@fgcu.edu)
  - Phone: 239-745-4199

If these classes do not align with your research interests or schedule, notify the instructor via the Lab Methods discussion on Canvas and provide a specific, research-related makeup plan (e.g., watching relevant tutorials, reviewing methods papers, or completing targeted readings).

#### Homework 1–4

- Homework 1 – Topic Identification (Graded, Participation):
  Submit your topic to ensure it is feasible, clear, and aligned with your interests and available resources.

- Homework 2–4 – Research Question, Introduction, Method (Ungraded Checkpoints):
  Complete these as progress milestones and discuss directly with your supervisor for feedback and guidance.


#### Presentations 1–3

For each presentation cycle:

1. Upload: Submit your presentation on Canvas **before** the start of presentation week. Uploading your presentation by the due date to give your classmates enough time to review your presentation and provide meaningful feedback.

4. Respond & Evaluate: Answer questions on your presentation and upload four peer-evaluation forms.
5. Late Policy: The [Late Assignment Policy](#late-assignment-policy) applies.

## Assessment and Grading  

### Assessment plan (100%)  
- Participation: 50%

### General notes  
- Grades Due from Faculty by noon Tuesday, 16 December 2025  
- If you are falling behind, consult the academic calendar for the last day to drop: [https://www.fgcu.edu/academics/academiccalendar/](https://www.fgcu.edu/academics/academiccalendar/)  
- Incomplete grades are granted in exceptional circumstances (e.g., medical emergency)

### Participation 

For participation you need to:
- Watch recorded videos and complete exit tickets (about 25 videos)
- Complete all participation questions in the recorded videos (0–3 per video)
- Complete all reading assignment activities (4 assignments)
- Complete all presentation activities (3 presentations)
- General course surveys (e.g., Get-to-Know-You, Midterm Feedback, SPoI)

These activities form the majority of your participation grade. Students must document the participation activities as shown on Canvas. For example, 
the [Exit Ticket Participation Log](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/participation) provide instructions for documenting your exit tickets and participation questions in the recorded videos.

### Report and Presentation   

- **Plan Ahead:** Effective time management is essential. Students requesting final proposal reviews must do so **at least one week before** the deadline to allow meaningful feedback.
- **Last-Minute Requests:** Requests made on the final day should be limited to specific, legitimate questions—not full proposal reviews or issues caused by ignoring prior feedback.
- **Professional Collaboration:** Treat the instructor and research supervisor as collaborative team members, engaging constructively.
- **Professionalism and Growth:** Grades reflect professional attitude, maturity, responsiveness to feedback, and demonstrated improvement over the semester.
- **Written Work Quality:** All submissions must be polished, well-organized, clear, and free from grammatical, spelling, and typographical errors following the [proposal assignment](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/proposal-hw) and [proposal rubric](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/proposal-rubric)
- **Presentation Quality:** Oral presentations should be well-organized, practiced, professional, and supported with effective visuals or graphics following the [presentation assignment](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/presentation-hw)
- **Assessment Basis:** Work will be evaluated using posted rubrics, peer feedback, and instructor observations.

## Course Policies

### Generative AI Policy  
Use of generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Consensus) is prohibited on any assignment marked “AI Not Permitted” and will result in a grade of zero. For all other work, AI use must be cited. Violations will be treated as academic dishonesty and will be subject to [Policy for Academic Integrity Violations](#policy-for-academic-integrity-violations).

### Late Submission Policy  
- If you encounter challenges that may affect your ability to submit on time, please communicate with the instructor as early as possible to explore possible accommodations.
- Deadline maybe extended for [execused absences](#Execused-Absence-Policy)
- Unexecused late submissions received after the deadline will incur a penalty of 20% per day of the total possible points
- Once the solutions and grades are posted, late unexecused submissions will not be accepted, and a score of zero will be assigned

### Execused Absence Policy
- Absence excuse requires written documentation from a certified medical professional, faculty member, administration, coach, or athletic director.
- Absence will be execused after the verification of the submitted document
- Any attempt to falsify documents will be taken very seriously in accordance with the [Policy for Academic Integrity Violations](#policy-for-academic-integrity-violations).

### Financial Aid Statement  
As of fall 2015, all faculty members are required to use Canvas to confirm a student's attendance for each course by the end of the first week of classes. Failure to do so will result in a delay in the disbursement of your financial aid. Confirmation of attendance is required for all students, not only those receiving financial aid.

### Policy for Academic Integrity Violations  
- Academic dishonesty in any course activity including participation, assignments, projects, or exams will result in a grade of zero for that submission and will be strictly addressed in line with FGCU policies and procedures. [FGCU Academic Integrity Flowchart](https://fgcucdn.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/files/academic_integrity_flowchart_2019.pdf)  
- You are required to familiarize yourself with the FGCU Student Guidebook that outlines the consequences for academic integrity violations: [FGCU Student Guidebook](https://www.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/)

### Core Syllabus Policies  
FGCU has a set of central policies related to student recording class sessions, academic integrity and grievances, student accessibility services, academic disruption, generative AI, and religious observances that apply to all courses at FGCU. Be sure to review these online at: [FGCU Core Syllabus Policy Statements](https://www.fgcu.edu/about/leadership/officeoftheprovost/core-syllabus-policy-statements)

### Syllabus Change Policy  
Except for changes that substantially affect the implementation of the evaluation (grading) statement, this syllabus is a guide for the course and is subject to change with advance notice.
