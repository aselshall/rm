### Assessment plan (100%)  
- Participation: 10%  
- Homework: 20%  
- Research project presentation: 25%  
- Research project proposal: 45%  

### General notes  
- Grades Due from Faculty by noon Tuesday, 17 December 2024  
- If you are falling behind, consult the academic calendar for the last day to drop: [https://www.fgcu.edu/academics/academiccalendar/](https://www.fgcu.edu/academics/academiccalendar/)  
- Incomplete grades are granted in exceptional circumstances (e.g., medical emergency)

### Participation and Attendance  
**Participation:**  
For participation assessment, students are expected to:  
- Arrive on time and attend every class for the entire class period.  
- Actively participate in discussions without being called upon by the instructor. Questions in class and office hours are highly encouraged.  
- Be present in class, meaning avoid web browsing, texting, off-subject discussions, or other non-academic activities that impact your class participation grade.  
- Read assigned materials before class to prepare for discussion and to incorporate what is learned from the readings in the class discussion.  
- Fill out exit tickets meaningfully to provide the instructor with constructive feedback and suggestions.

All these will be evident by the quality of your class participation, which forms the majority of your participation grade.

**Specific notes:**  
- Let the instructor know at the beginning of class if you anticipate an event (e.g., emergency phone call, appointment) that will disrupt the class activities.  
- Two warnings regarding engaging in non-class-related activities will be counted as one absence.

**Attendance:**  
Regular attendance in classes is expected.  
- Notify the instructor if you anticipate missing class.  
- Students are responsible for any missed material or changes in assignments, times, dates, or due dates announced in class.  
- Unavoidable absences do not excuse students from responsibility for course material.  
- Attendance will be monitored using a “sign-in sheet" for each class meeting.  
- It is the responsibility of the student to sign in during each class attended.  
- A student is considered absent if their signature does not appear on the sign-in sheet.  
- Forgery of signatures on a sign-in sheet is a violation of university Academic Integrity Policies and subject to disciplinary action.

**Tardiness:**  
- Each two instances of excessive tardiness (> 5 minutes) will count as one absence.  
- Two instances of leaving class early will also count as one absence.

**Excused Absence Policy:**  
- Absence excuse requires written documentation from a certified medical

 professional, faculty member, administration, coach, or athletic director.  
- Absence will be excused after the verification of the submitted document.  
- Any attempt to falsify documents will be taken very seriously in accordance with FGCU policies and procedures: [FGCU Academic Integrity Policies](https://fgcucdn.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/files/academic_integrity_flowchart_2019.pdf)

**Absences:**  
Unexcused absences affect the final course grade according to the following schedule:  
- Up to 2 Absences: No effect on final grade  
- 3 Absences: Final grade lowered by half a letter grade (e.g., from A to A-)  
- 4 Absences: Final grade lowered by one full letter grade (e.g., from A to B)  
- 5 or more absences: Final grade of 0 assigned (Official withdrawal recommended)

### Assignment and Report Assessment  
- All written work is expected to be polished and professional. Clarity of expression, organization of materials, absence of typographical errors, correctness of grammar and spelling, and other communication skills are considered in evaluating written assignments.  
- All work must be fully referenced with source material following proper citation format according to The American Geophysical Union style (paper provided as an example).  
- All oral presentations are expected to be well-organized, practiced, professional, and with appropriate graphical or visual aids.  
- Teamwork will be assessed using the teamwork rubric posted on Canvas, student surveys, and instructor observations. A student’s individual grade may be above or below the group grade based on these assessments.

### Late Assignment and Report Policy  
- If you encounter challenges that may affect your ability to submit on time, please communicate with the instructor as early as possible to explore possible accommodations.  
- The deadline may be extended for excused absences.  
- Unexcused late submissions received after the deadline will incur a penalty of 10% per day of the total possible points for up to 50%.  
- Once the solutions and grades are posted, late unexcused submissions will not be accepted, and a score of zero will be assigned.

### Policy for Academic Integrity Violations  
- Academic dishonesty in assignments, projects, or exams will result in a grade of zero for that submission and will be strictly addressed in line with FGCU policies and procedures. [FGCU Academic Integrity Flowchart](https://fgcucdn.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/files/academic_integrity_flowchart_2019.pdf)  
- Familiarize yourself with the FGCU Student Guidebook that outlines the consequences for academic integrity violations: [FGCU Student Guidebook](https://www.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/)

## Program Learning Outcomes  
The learning outcomes for the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) Program are as follows.

### Content/Discipline Knowledge and Skills (DK) – MSE graduates will be able to:  
1. Apply higher-level math, science, and engineering skills to research and/or design engineering systems, components, or processes to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability.  
2. Understand the professional and ethical responsibilities associated with engineering practice and engineering research.  
3. Use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice and engineering research.  

Content/discipline knowledge and skills are assessed at the program level using appropriate coursework including examinations, assignments, and presentations.

### Communication Skills (CS) – MSE graduates will be able to:  
1. Organize and relate ideas coherently in written, oral, and graphic form.  
2. Develop and present consistent arguments to diverse audiences.

Communication skills are assessed at the University, College, and Program levels through oral and written presentations, project reports, and other assignments throughout the curriculum.

### Critical Thinking Skills (CT) – MSE graduates will be able to:  
1. Identify problems and the relevant information needed to solve them.  
2. Analyze and synthesize information and draw reasoned inferences.  
3. Formulate and evaluate appropriate problem-solving strategies.

Critical thinking skills are assessed at the University, College, and Program levels through oral and written presentations, project reports, exams, and other assignments throughout the curriculum.

### Financial Aid Statement  
As of fall 2015, all faculty members are required to use Canvas to confirm a student's attendance for each course by the end of the first week of classes. Failure to do so will result in a delay in the disbursement of your financial aid. Confirmation of attendance is required for all students, not only those receiving financial aid.

### Generative AI use  
Generative AI such as ChatGPT, Gimini, Claude, and DeepL should not be used in assignments and exams when indicated by the text “LLM Not Permitted”. Students must cite the used generative AI tool, and failing to do so will be considered academic dishonesty. Check FGCU Generative AI policy for more details.

### Core Syllabus Policies  
FGCU has a set of central policies related to student recording class sessions, academic integrity and grievances, student accessibility services, academic disruption, generative AI, and religious observances that apply to all courses at FGCU. Be sure to review these online at: [FGCU Core Syllabus Policy Statements](https://www.fgcu.edu/about/leadership/officeoftheprovost/core-syllabus-policy-statements)
