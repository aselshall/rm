### Laboratory Methods Classes
- In-person and off-campus at the Emergent Technologies Institute (ETI)
- Class : M W -- 04:30pm - 05:45pm 
- Address: 16301 Innovation Ln, Fort Myers, FL 33913
- Instructor: Huan Luong, Research Laboratory Manager, hluong@fgcu.edu, 239-745-4199

If these laboratory methods classes do not align with your research interests or schedule, please inform the instructor that you will not be attending and provide a specific makeup plan that is directly related to your research proposal (e.g., watching relevant YouTube tutorials, reviewing methods papers, or completing targeted readings).

### Homework 1–4
#### Homework 1 (Topic Identification):
- You are required to submit Homework 1.
- This submission will contribute toward your participation grade.
- It helps ensure your selected topic is feasible, clear, and aligns with your interests and resources.

#### Homework 2–4 (Research Question, Introduction, Method):
- These tasks are structured as non-graded checkpoints.
- You will discuss these checkpoints directly with your supervisor.
- These checkpoints ensure that your research progresses steadily, with opportunities for expert feedback from your supervisor.

### Class Presentations 1–3 
- Upload your class presentation on Canvas before the start of the presentation week, and submit your peer review comments by the end of that week.
- For example, class Presentation 1: Research Problem (Week 5, Sep 15–Sep 21):
    - Presentation upload due: Sunday, Sep 14 at 11:59 PM
    - Peer review comments due: Sunday, Sep 21 at 11:59 PM
- Submit your presentation by the due date to give your classmates enough time to review your presentation and provide meaningful feedback.
- You are required to review three classmates’ presentations and provide meaningful feedback.
- Reviews are first come, first served, so if a presentation already has three reviews, choose one with fewer.
- [Late Assignment Policy](#late-assignment-policy) will apply.  

### General notes  
- Grades Due from Faculty by noon Tuesday, 16 December 2025  
- If you are falling behind, consult the academic calendar for the last day to drop: [https://www.fgcu.edu/academics/academiccalendar/](https://www.fgcu.edu/academics/academiccalendar/)  
- Incomplete grades are granted in exceptional circumstances (e.g., medical emergency)

## Assessment and Grading  
### Grading scale  
The instructor may elect to employ a curve that favors the students.

The instructor may elect to employ a curve that favors the students.

| Grade | Range | Grade| Range | Grade | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 94% or above | B- | 80% to 82.99% | D+ | 67% to 69.99% |
| A- | 90% to 93.99% | C+ | 77% to 79.99% | D | 60% to 66.99% |
| B+ | 87% to 89.99% | C | 73% to 76.99% | F | Below 60% |
| B | 83% to 86.99% | C- | 70% to 72.99% |

### Assessment plan (100%)  
- Participation: 50%  
- Research project presentation: 25%  
- Research project proposal: 25%  

### Participation 
For participation assessment, students are expected to:
- Watch recorded videos and fill-out exit tickets and [participation log](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/hw/participation)
- Complete the survey at the end of each module meaningfully to provide instructor with constructive feedback and suggestions   

These form the majority of your participation grade.

### Report and Presentation Assessment  
- Effective time management is key for success in this course. For example, students who request additional final proposal reviews, need to do this at least one week before the final submission deadline to allow for meaningful feedback.
- Last-day requests should be limited to specific and legitimate questions, not for reviewing entire proposal or resolving issues stemming from ignored feedback throughout the semester.
- Teamwork is a key skill and the student is expected to engage with the instructor and advisor as collaborative team members.
- Your grade will reflect your professional attitude and professional maturity during the course including addressing instructor feedback constructively and showing steady improvement.
- All written work is expected to be polished and professional. Clarity of expression, organization of materials, absence of typographical errors, correctness of grammar and spelling, and other communication skills are considered in evaluating written assignments.  
- All work must be fully referenced with source material following proper citation format according to The American Geophysical Union style.
- All oral presentations are expected to be well-organized, practiced, professional, and with appropriate graphical or visual aids.  
- Your work will be assessed based on rubrics posted on Canvas, peer-student feedback, and instructor observations.
 
## Course Policies

### Generative AI Policy  
Use of generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Consensus) is prohibited on any assignment marked “AI Not Permitted” and will result in a grade of zero. For all other work, AI use must be cited. Violations will be treated as academic dishonesty and will be subject to [Policy for Academic Integrity Violations](#policy-for-academic-integrity-violations).

### Late Submission Policy  
- If you encounter challenges that may affect your ability to submit on time, please communicate with the instructor as early as possible to explore possible accommodations.
- Deadline maybe extended for [execused absences](#Execused-Absence-Policy)
- Unexecused late submissions received after the deadline will incur a penalty of 20% per day of the total possible points
- Once the solutions and grades are posted, late unexecused submissions will not be accepted, and a score of zero will be assigned

### Execused Absence Policy
- Absence excuse requires written documentation from a certified medical professional, faculty member, administration, coach, or athletic director.
- Absence will be execused after the verification of the submitted document
- Any attempt to falsify documents will be taken very seriously in accordance with the [Policy for Academic Integrity Violations](#policy-for-academic-integrity-violations).

### Financial Aid Statement  
As of fall 2015, all faculty members are required to use Canvas to confirm a student's attendance for each course by the end of the first week of classes. Failure to do so will result in a delay in the disbursement of your financial aid. Confirmation of attendance is required for all students, not only those receiving financial aid.

### Policy for Academic Integrity Violations  
- Academic dishonesty in any course activity including participation, assignments, projects, or exams will result in a grade of zero for that submission and will be strictly addressed in line with FGCU policies and procedures. [FGCU Academic Integrity Flowchart](https://fgcucdn.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/files/academic_integrity_flowchart_2019.pdf)  
- You are required to familiarize yourself with the FGCU Student Guidebook that outlines the consequences for academic integrity violations: [FGCU Student Guidebook](https://www.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/)

### Core Syllabus Policies  
FGCU has a set of central policies related to student recording class sessions, academic integrity and grievances, student accessibility services, academic disruption, generative AI, and religious observances that apply to all courses at FGCU.
