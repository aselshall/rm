The "Big Picture" document is clear and well-structured, but it can still be improved for better readability and coherence. Here is a further refined version:

### The Big Picture

#### Understand

1. **Select a Research Topic**:
   - Choose a topic that interests you and aligns with your goals.

2. **Conduct an Exploratory Literature Search**:
   - Refine your topic and start developing a research question.

3. **Conduct an In-Depth Literature Review**:
   - Document your findings (Homework 3).
   - Address these key points:
     - Why is this research important?
     - What has been done so far, and what do you want to contribute?
     - Refine and sharpen your research question.
   - **Note**: The literature review should tell a cohesive story, not just list facts. By the end, the reader should understand the topic, what has been done, and why your study is necessary to fill gaps in knowledge or provide solutions.
   - **Output**: A problem statement and research question (about half a page) describing the problem clearly, specifically, and concisely. Include the relationships between variables or the tasks you will undertake.

#### Tips and Suggestions
- Keep your research question realistic by considering resources, data availability, your skills, and time constraints.
- Plan your timeline for implementing the research (e.g., next semester’s project course, MS thesis project).
- A limited scope with good outcomes is better than an overly ambitious project that leads to a dead-end.
- Consult with an expert (e.g., FGCU faculty member or course instructor) for guidance and to discuss feasibility.
- If in doubt, ask for help.
- Enjoy learning about your problem and developing your plan.

#### Plan

4. **Method Development (How)**:
   - Include components such as study duration, site or experiment description, data and instrumentation, analytical methods and procedures, data analysis, pilot results, and study limitations.

5. **Proposal Development**:
   - Outline the “why, what, and how” (including pilot results if available).
   - Define deliverables and how to measure success.
   - Explain potential outcomes, benefits, intellectual merits, broader impacts, and the “so what” question.

#### Do

6. **Project Implementation**:
   - Implement your research during the next semester’s ENG 6941 Project course, your MS thesis research, or start this semester if you are ready.

7. **Write Up Your Project Results and Discussion**:
   - Document your findings and discussion in the next semester’s ENG 6941 Project course or your MS thesis research.

#### Publish

8. **Disseminate Your Findings**:
   - Share your results through conference proceedings, peer-reviewed publications, blog posts, etc.
